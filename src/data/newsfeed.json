    text: "Even if you expect to live a fairly modest lifestyle in retirement, you’ll still need money to pay for it. In fact, Social Security will generally do a good job of replacing 40% of your former income, more or less, if you’re an average wage-earner. But most seniors need 70% of their former income or more to live comfortably.
    Even if you’re willing to cut corners as a senior and move to a part of the country where the cost of living is cheap, there’s a good chance you still won’t manage to get by on Social Security alone. Those benefits pay the average recipient around $18,000 a year today, so even if you’re amenable to living in a small home and sticking to local entertainment, you may find that $1,500 a month just won’t cut it when you factor in essential expenses like transportation, healthcare, and food.
    It’s for this reason that saving for retirement independently is crucial; you need some amount of extra money to supplement your Social Security income. Yet 21% of Americans have not yet started saving for their senior years, according to a new FinanceBuzz survey, and alarmingly, that includes almost 16% of Gen Xers and more than 12% of baby boomers.
    If you’ve yet to start building your nest egg, you should know that the longer you wait, the harder it will be to grow wealth for retirement. On the other hand, if you start making modest contributions to a savings plan today, you stand a better chance of accumulating enough of a balance to avoid financial struggles later in life. Why it pays to start saving for retirement immediately
    When it comes to growing retirement wealth, your greatest weapon is none other than time. The more years you have to invest your savings, the more money you stand to end up with. That’s why delaying your savings is a bad idea. Even if you’re only in a position to start socking away $50 or $100 a month right now, over time, it will make a big difference.
    In fact, let’s say you’re 27 years old and think you’ll retire at 67, which is full retirement age for Social Security purposes. If you start setting aside $100 a month in an IRA or 401(k) now, and continue doing so for 40 years, you’ll wind up with about $240,000, assuming your invested savings deliver an average annual 7% return during that time. That return is a few percentage points lower than what the stock market has averaged over time, and it’s a reasonable assumption for someone with a 40-year savings window.
    Of course, if you’re no longer in your 20s, you may need to do a lot better on the retirement savings front than $100 a month. Say you’re 42, with 25 years left until retirement. In that case, it will take a little over $300 a month in contributions to accumulate around $240,000 in savings, assuming that same 7% return. The point, however, is that the sooner you begin funding an IRA or 401(k), the less money you’ll need to contribute to build wealth, because once that money is in your retirement plan, you’ll get to put it to work immediately.
    Finally, remember that there’s nothing wrong with starting really small on the retirement savings front and working your way up as your income increases. If you can only swing $20 a month right now, go for it. You may be in a position to do much better in a couple of years from now, but that way, you’ll at least get the ball rolling.",

    title: "3 Ways to Help Your Retirement Savings Last Longer",
    text: "The average worker expects to need nearly $2 million to retire comfortably, according to a recent report from Charles Schwab. That’s a lofty goal, especially considering tens of millions of Americans are unemployed thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.
    Not everyone will be able to afford to save $2 million for retirement, and that’s okay. What you can do, no matter how much you have saved, is ensure you’re taking steps to make your savings last. And there are a few things you can do to stretch every dollar in retirement. 1. Establish a realistic withdrawal rate
    Your withdrawal rate is how much you’re taking from your retirement fund each year. If you don’t establish a withdrawal rate and simply take whatever you need from your savings without considering how it will affect your long-term plan, you risk running out of money too soon.
    One common withdrawal guideline is the 4% rule, which states that you can withdraw 4% of your total savings during the first year of retirement, then adjust your withdrawals each subsequent year for inflation.
    The 4% rule is a good starting point, but it has its drawbacks. For one, it assumes you’ll be spending the same amount year after year (adjusted for inflation), when in reality, your spending may fluctuate throughout retirement. In addition, the 4% rule is designed to help your savings last 30 years, which could result in you spending more conservatively than necessary in retirement if you don’t need your money to last that long.
    Exactly how much you withdraw each year will depend on your unique situation, so it may be a good idea to talk to a financial advisor and develop a plan. Or if you choose to go the DIY route, use the 4% rule as a benchmark to make sure you’re in the right ballpark as you’re deciding how much to withdraw each year. 2. Make sure you’re investing appropriately for your age
    Every so often, you may need to make some adjustments to your asset allocation to ensure you’re not investing too aggressively or conservatively.
    Generally, the older you are, the more conservative your portfolio should be — meaning you should be investing more in bonds and less in stocks. This can protect your savings against stock market volatility, which will, in turn, help your savings last longer in retirement. If you invest too aggressively and a market downturn causes your portfolio to take a nosedive, your savings may not last as long as you need them to.
    That said, it’s also important not to be too conservative. When you’re decades from retirement, you can afford to invest more aggressively because your savings have plenty of time to recover from any market downturns. However, even as you get older, you should still aim to allocate at least a portion of your portfolio toward stocks so your investments continue to grow as much as possible.
    One good rule of thumb to consider is subtracting your age from 110 to determine how much you should be investing in stocks. So, for instance, if you’re 65 years old, you should aim to allocate 45% of your portfolio toward stocks and 55% toward bonds. Keep in mind that this is just a guideline, so you might adjust these numbers based on how risk-tolerant or risk-averse you are. 3. Avoid withdrawing from your retirement fund before you retire
    It can be tempting to pull cash from your retirement savings if you face a financial emergency, and in some cases, it may be unavoidable. However, if at all possible, try your best to avoid withdrawing money from your retirement fund before you retire.
    Your savings rely on compound interest to help them grow, and every time you make a withdrawal from your retirement fund, that’s money that is no longer growing. Over time, even small withdrawals can make a significant difference, and if you’re repeatedly taking money from your retirement fund over the years, that will add up quickly.
    For example, say you currently have $100,000 stashed in your retirement account, and your investments are earning a 7% annual rate of return. Without making any additional contributions, you’d have accumulated around $387,000 in 20 years. But if you withdraw $5,000 now, all other factors remaining the same, you’d only have around $367,000 saved in that time period. In other words, that $5,000 withdrawal can result in missing out on $20,000 in potential investment gains. And if you were to consistently withdraw from your savings, the results could be even more drastic.
    No matter how much you have saved for retirement, it’s wise to ensure you’re making the most of every dollar. By being strategic about how you plan for your senior years, you can help your savings last as long as possible.",

    text: "Stocks rose on Friday, lifted by strong U.S. economic data, to end a week that saw the broader market reach a record level.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the session up 190.6 points at 27,930.33, a gain of about 0.7%. The S&P 500 advanced 0.34% to 3,397.16, a new record closing high. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4% and ended the day at 11,311.80, also a record close.
    Apple shares rose 5.1% to an all-time high, building on this week’s strong gain. Deere and Foot Locker jumped 4.4% and 1.4%, respectively, on better-than-expected quarterly results.
    Data from IHS Markit showed U.S. manufacturing activity hit its highest level in 19 months in August, while services were at their highest level in 17 months. IHS Markit economist Sian Jones said in a statement: “Client demand picked up among both manufacturers and service providers.”
    “After seeing some disappointing PMIs in Japan, Australia and for the Eurozone, the US print was a pleasant surprise but again reflecting more reopenings and the byproduct from that is an economic recovery,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. However, “the expansion above and beyond the February GDP level remains to be seen.”
    Meanwhile, existing-home sales for July saw a record month-over-month spike of 24.7%. The average selling price for homes also hit an all-time high, jumping to $304,100.
    Earlier this week, the S&P 500 broke above its late-February high and notched a fresh all-time high. The S&P 500 gained 0.7% for the week while the Nasdaq added over 2.5% in that time.
    The lion’s share of those gains has been driven by strong gains in Big Tech stocks. Apple rose 8.2% this week and became the first publicly traded company in the U.S. to reach a market valuation of $2 trillion. Amazon and Alphabet rallied over 4% this week while Microsoft gained 1.97%.
    “These are great companies and they are likely to continue to deliver solid earnings growth, but one has to wonder if there isn’t too much enthusiasm baked into their current stock prices,” said Brian Price, head of investment management at Commonwealth Financial Network.
    “It would be constructive for the overall health of the stock market if we started to see wider breadth and other sectors showing relative strength,” he added. “We’ve had a few minor rallies in cyclical value-oriented sectors off the March lows but none that have been sustainable.”
    Concerns over a new coronavirus stimulus bill kept the market’s gains in check Friday.
    House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told PBS that both sides need to reach a deal on a more comprehensive stimulus package as millions struggle with being furloughed and unemployed amid the coronavirus pandemic. Pelosi’s comments come as Democrats and Republicans have been at a stalemate over additional unemployment benefits that expired last month.
    Democrats have indicated they want to reinstate the additional assistance at the original $600-per-week rate; Republicans have offered to extend the benefits at a lower rate.
    The impasse comes as the U.S. economy tries to recover from the pandemic’s massive blow. The Labor Department said Thursday that initial weekly jobless claims came in above 1 million.
    On Wednesday, the Fed released the minutes from its July meeting that said the coronavirus pandemic “would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term.”",

    Steve Bannon build the wall fraud allegations D'antonio (Originally Published: 08/21/2020 10:10 PM) Highlights: Crime, law enforcement and corrections Criminal law What Steve Bannon arrest reveals about 'building the wall' Opinion by Michael D'Antonio
    Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success" and co-author with Peter Eisner of "The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.
    The arrest of Trump's ex-campaign chief and former White House advisor Steve Bannon, and three others, on federal charges that they defrauded those who donated to a nonprofit called -- wait for it -- We Build The Wall -- has added one more big name to the list of Trump-adjacent figures who have found trouble with the law.
    For years it's seemed like a parade of conmen has trailed the President and that prosecutors have tried to pick them off one-by-one.
    Federal authorities allege that Bannon and others broke their promise to direct millions of those donated dollars to the cause of securing the border with Mexico --the cause Donald Trump rode to political prominence in 2015. (Bannon's lawyer entered a plea of not guilty Thursday and his client was set to be released on bail including a $5 million bond to be secured by $1.75 million in cash or real property.)
    Upon hearing the news of yet another scandal, one's natural response might well be: Of course.
    Of course, the President's former White House chief strategist is alleged to have swindled hundreds of thousands of Trump devotees out of more than $25 million .
    Of course, his non-profit said the money was going to build a giant border wall, the one Trump said Mexico was going to pay for.
    Of course, Bannon is charged with using hundreds of thousands of dollars for personal expenses after repeatedly promising all funds would go to that wall-building.
    Of course, We Build the Wall hasn't actually built much wall . How much? Published reports vary, but an investigation by the Texas Tribune and Propublica (published in July, before the indictment), and which paints an unflattering picture of engineering snafus and accusations of political shenanigans, puts it at around 3 miles.
    And of course, the President distanced himself from the man who helped make him President , saying the whole notion of private funding for the wall was "inappropriate" and a case of "showboating."
    Read the indictment and you'll find a recitation of allegations that shock the conscience, even one dulled by exposure to Trumpworld.
    According to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York: $1 million was sent from the wall-builder group to one of Bannon's separate organizations so that some of it could be funneled "secretly" to We Build The Wall's founder Brian Kolfage, who was also indicted. Bannon also allegedly used hundreds of thousands of it to cover his own personal expenses. (Kolfage did not immediately respond to requests for comments, CNN reported Thursday). Kolfage promised that 100% of donations would be devoted to erecting the wall Bannon and a venture capitalist named Andrew Badolato jumped into the operation after questions arose about Kolfage's past. (Badolato did not immediately respond to requests for comments, CNN reported Thursday.) They repeatedly made public promises to potential donors that Kolfage would get none of WBTW's money, and in text messages with Bannon, Badolato noted that Kolfage's self-abnegation would confer upon him what he termed "saint hood" in the eyes of donors. Some donors "wrote directly to Kolfage that they did not have a lot of money and were skeptical about online fundraising campaigns, but they were giving what they could because they trusted Kolfage would keep his word about how their donations were being spent," according to the indictment.
    The scheme alleged by the prosecutors seems like the kind of fraud you might expect to be perpetrated by shady purveyors of penny stocks. To borrow from a Trump campaign phrase, promises were made...but apparently with no intention that they would be kept. Instead, recalling Trump's say-anything style of operating, Bannon and the others made their pledges and, according to prosecutors, promptly abandoned them.
    The indictment includes references to Bannon's alleged desire to control how Kolfage would actually get paid. (He insisted in a text to Badolato: "no deals I don't approve," according to the indictment.)
    With Bannon's arrest, he returns to public view after a period when he seemed to have disappeared. A distinctively noticeable, if scruffy, presence ( Trump called him "Sloppy Steve" ) Bannon seemed to be everywhere in the run-up to the 2016 election and in the first year of the Trump presidency. In February 2017 he appeared on the cover of Time alongside the headline "The Great Manipulator."
    Bannon, a political propagandist, sold himself to the public with a story that included his claim that he was moved to outrage when his working-class father lost money in the stock market. Problem was Bannon was already engaged in his right-wing populism at the time his father lost that money . And his dad had made the decidedly risky choice to buy some of the stock he sold on an apparently bad tip--losing a hundred thousand dollars, Bannon told an interviewer--with borrowed money. As Nicholas Lemann of The New Yorker would conclude, Steve Bannon's origin claim was "political mythology."
    The journey from mythmaking to alleged fraud can be a very short one. Consider, for example, Donald Trump's so-called "Trump University." Trump agreed to pay $25 million in 2018 to settle claims from people who said they had been cheated by the "university." (His lawyer said Trump had settled the case "without an acknowledgment of fault or liability," according to the New York Times)
    He then paid a $2 million penalty last December for misusing a nonprofit charity--the Donald J. Trump Foundation --controlled by him. The New York attorney general's 2018 lawsuit in the matter, according to the Washington Post, alleged the President had illegally "used the charity's cash to buy paintings of himself and sports memorabilia and to pay $258,000 in legal settlements for his for-profit clubs," as well as make donation to political campaigns.
    The foundation was shuttered, and the President agreed to comply with restrictions if he ever again undertakes charitable work in New York state.
    Among the other Trump allies who have been indicted or imprisoned we can count the President's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort (Bannon effectively replaced him); his former lawyer, Michael Cohen; his one-time national security advisor, Michael Flynn; Manafort's deputy, Rick Gates; Representatives Chris Collins and Duncan Hunter (two early Trump supporters); and donor/political operatives Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman , who have pleaded not guilty to criminal charges that they funneled foreign money into US elections. The two are linked closely with Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, and have aided Giuliani's effort to compile what he has claimed is damaging information on Trump's political rival, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, according to CNN reporting.
    In every instance these are men who apparently promoted themselves with the kind of hype that connoisseurs of Trumpism would find familiar. This is the company the President keeps .
    Still available for viewing on the morning of Bannon's arrest, We Build the Wall's website is a super-patriot mash-up that is also true to the Trump style. It features a photo of one of Bannon's co-defendants, square-jawed Brian Kolfage, with a pile of medals pinned to his suit jacket. Click around and you'll find photos of the usual cast of controversial characters, including the President and his son Donald Jr. (the latter appeared at a WBTW-sponsored symposium in July 2019 ); the former Milwaukee County sheriff and Trump acolyte, David Clarke , famous for his cowboy hat; and Kansas crusader Kris Kobach, who bellowed about widespread voter fraud but couldn't find it after Trump put him in charge of a commission devoted to exposing it.
    From the focus of the wall-building non-profit to his arrest in Connecticut, aboard the yacht of exiled Chinese dissident Guo Wengui, irony abounds in faux-populist Steven Bannon's case . It should be noted that investigators from the US Postal Service--much maligned by Trump as he faces an election that will be carried out in large part by mail-in vote-- have been involved in the case, and that the Southern District of New York is bringing the case.
    One can imagine the President's pique over Bannon's arrest coming on the day his rival Joe Biden was nominated at the Democratic National Convention. The President said during his 2016 campaign that he would hire "the best people ." Bannon is the latest in a seemingly ever-growing list of Trump associates to face federal criminal charges. Talk about contradicting the boss. ",

    (Newsdio) President Donald Trump ‘s relentless effort to undermine Joe Biden as “Sleepy Joe” backfired this week when the former vice president delivered a forceful speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination. Now the pressure is on the President to right his own campaign as he heads into the Republican National Convention next week.
    Trump, a former television producer and the ultimate showman, is heavily involved in the planning for the four-day extravaganza that will give him an opportunity for a reset. He is aiming to create a more dynamic program than the Democrats with more live programming and audience interaction to lift his poll numbers.
    Over the course of the summer, Trump has fallen behind Biden in national polls amid voters’ disapproval of the President’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the protests against police brutality and systematic racism following the death of George Floyd. He must now match Biden’s well-received appearance and try to generate excitement for his reelection campaign at a time when many Americans are rightly focused on the pandemic. Contents 2 A tough week for the White House Trump attacks ‘darkest’ and ‘gloomiest’ convention
    Looking to bolster his image before a consortium of conservative groups Friday morning, Trump once again compared himself to Abraham Lincoln and refuted the efforts by Democrats to portray him as a leader who has shirked responsibility for fighting the virus while deepening the polarization in this country with his race-baiting campaign.
    Democrats “held the darkest and angriest and gloomiest convention in American history,” he said with no note of irony, even though it is he who has accused them of sowing chaos and disorder in the nation’s streets as part of “a merciless campaign to wipe out our history” and “erase our values.”
    “They spent four straight days attacking America as racist and a horrible country that must be redeemed,” Trump continued, rejecting Biden’s argument that the President has plunged the country into “a season of American darkness” and that he hoped to lead the country back into the light.
    “It was the most successful period of time in the history of our country, from every standard,” Trump said of his presidency. “Look what we’ve accomplished.”
    Alluding to the promising signs of economic recovery — from record retail sales to the performance of the stock market — he said the economy is “shooting up” into a “super V” and Democrats are “probably not happy about it,” he said.
    “Where Joe Biden sees American darkness, I see American greatness,” Trump said in remarks that foreshadowed the GOP message at the convention next week. “We’ve seen heroic doctors and nurses racing into action to save lives. We’ve seen first responders helping strangers in need. We’ve seen the passage of historic legislation to save 50 million American jobs.”
    The pandemic has now claimed more than 175,000 lives , cast countless Americans from their jobs and created havoc in the nation’s school systems as Trump has pushed children to return to in-person instruction despite the risks.
    But the President took credit Friday for having built “military hospitals from scratch” and “produced lifesaving therapies” and said the nation is “on track to develop the most incredible — from a standpoint of time, record time — vaccines.”
    In a round of television appearances earlier on Friday, Vice President Mike Pence said he hoped the United States would have one or more coronavirus vaccines by the end of the year, despite intense skepticism from medical experts that a vaccine can be produced safely within that short amount of time. Pence appeared to admit he was wrong when he suggested in June there “isn’t a coronavirus second wave,” saying that “things changed.”
    Even if the administration pulls off some kind of October surprise, in the form of a vaccine or treatment for Covid-19, Republicans have a tall task ahead of them next week as they try to convince wavering voters that the pandemic is under control and that Trump is focused on their concerns — rather than his political prospects. A tough week for the White House
    As Democrats hammered their anti-Trump message during a convention that they said drew 122 million live viewers as they raised $70 million , the White House has been contending with a series of scandals this week.
    Joining a long line of Trump advisers ensnared by the law, the President’s former strategist Steve Bannon was charged with defrauding donors of hundreds of thousands of dollars that were supposed to be directed to a fundraising campaign known as We Build the Wall that was aimed at building a section of Trump’s border wall.
    Bannon called the charges by New York federal prosecutors “a political hit job.”
    At the same time, the White House has been trying to regroup after a national backlash to the administration’s effort to undermine the post office in the lead-up to a national election where many voters intend to vote by mail to limit their exposure to Covid-19.
    As he was being grilled by lawmakers at a Senate hearing Friday, Trump’s new postmaster general, Louis DeJoy , insisted that his recent changes to postal operations — including the removal of automated sorting machines — were not intended to help Republicans in November.
    DeJoy also said that he supports mail-in voting , despite the President’s effort to convince Americans that the practice is rife with corruption. Newsdio has found no evidence to support Trump’s claim that there has been widespread fraud when Americans vote that way.
    DeJoy, a big Trump fundraiser and GOP donor,told senators that he was “extremely, highly confident” that all ballots sent seven days before the election would be received on time.
    “I promise you, we are not making any changes until after the election,” he said during the hearing , adding that changes under his watch were intended to make sure Americans get “their mail faster.”
    And Trump is facing a new level of legal pressure with a federal appeals court opening the possibility Friday night that a grand jury could get his accounting records if Trump doesn’t secure Supreme Court help or a lifeline from prosecutors.
    Republicans other than the President have also been scrambling this week to distance themselves from the dangerous conspiracy theory known as QAnon after Trump seemed to praise the theory’s followers earlier this week. The affinity of QAnon followers for Trump drew fresh scrutiny after the Georgia primary victory of Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom Trump congratulated .
    During an appearance on Newsdio’s “New Day” Friday, Pence said he doesn’t “know anything” about the people involved in QAnon, a conspiracy theory that the FBI has labeled a potential domestic terrorist threat.
    “I called it a conspiracy theory, I said I don’t have time for it, I don’t know anything about it,” Pence said when pressed by Newsdio’s John Berman to disavow it.
    Among the theories embraced by QAnon is the wild and baseless idea that there is a high-level government official known as “Q” who leaves clues on the internet about a “deep state” conspiracy. Previous presidents, QAnon followers believe, were part of a criminal enterprise, and they say that Trump is the emissary allied with the military who will root out that corruption.
    Like Pence, Trump said during a White House briefing Wednesday that he didn’t know anything about the theories embraced by QAnon followers.
    “I’ve heard these are people that love our country,” Trump said. “So I don’t know, really, anything about it other than they do, supposedly, like me.”
    Trump’s decision to embrace fringe groups has long posed risks, but never more so than at a time in his reelection campaign when he must convince middle-of-the-road voters that he shares their values. Next week’s convention may be his best shot to persuade them that he deserves a second term. Share",

    text: "This is an excerpt from a short story, Lunaroo , from my new collection of short stories, Night of the Long Dr0nes (nine lives of Cecil Dalrymple) ,available Sept 22nd ’20
    ————————————————————–
    C. Dalrymple, Mare Vaporum
    [ W ell itâ€™s hardly Loonstock, is it? Or thatâ€™s what your Grandma might say. Mine wouldâ€™ve, anyway. But weâ€™re well passed the idea that a generation-defining moment is even possible, arenâ€™t we?
    And decades after thousands tripped on moonshrooms and vapours on these red-grassed â€œstrawberry fields foreverâ€, the modern incarnation of Loonstock returns faithfully to its historical position in the dome fields of Mare Vaporum. Never mind that its got macrotillas of Corporate sponsorship now and hereafter will be referred to correctly as Loonaroo , and any unifying features of a once straightforward MoonRock culture have totally dissolvedâ€Śjust think about how much more chill it is now that there isnâ€™t a frenzy, and we may never have to commit to a subculture entirely. Why should we, when itâ€™s less clear than ever before that we even have a major one, or even a major constellation of one, to subvert and subtract from? And for this yearâ€™s go round, spectacularly, thereâ€™s more moon-units of cultural flora and fauna to choose from than ever.
    Even just in the past year more of these little cults have cropped up than are even visible, but just in front of me now are spaces set up to feature MareCore, from the faux-undersea sound of the faux-undersea that started deep underground —literally — in places like Oceanus Procellarum City, and Loonwave, which like it or not is a marker of how popular Lunatic stuff is getting down on Earth, as its biggest roots are Terran and, moreover, Japanese. Thereâ€™s also the perennial silliness of MarsCore, and BeltCore, the most misunderstood new angsty genre that takes its name, and tenor, from the sharp edge of Orionâ€™s Belt, what we look to for our closest personal mythos.
    Not to mention everyoneâ€™s biggest and most long term iconic and ironic obsession since time immemorial, dare I say since the original Loonstock; country music from Earth. Indeed, for the first time this year Lunaroo will be headlined by none other than
    â€œSo what is this, your opus?â€ asks Phineas. Peering across the desert expanse of my device. His snarkiness, voice too patient, like his slash of a smile and his comically uncomfortable body language, makes me feel comforted, as per.
    â€œ This thing youâ€™re writing forâ€Ś this ?â€ He gestures vacuously, out at the general scene. A gathering gloom of people, and across a long, low field of a chaotic main-stage spread out in the shape of mothâ€™s wings, empty except for brightly dressed wranglers of equipment, happily cosplaying the rock-star lifestyle, sweating in the pretty mercurial ultra-glow of the smoky faux sunlight.
    â€œNobody says Oceanus Procellarum City . I donâ€™t care if youâ€™re writing for an Earth audience. Fuck that. Its just O.P.C. OK?â€
    â€œItâ€™s a contractual obligation that ORB1TAL had the misfortune to give me when they knew Iâ€™d be Up Here,â€ I explain rather woodenly, mirroring my brother, as I realise, now that we almost never see each other, I normally do.
    â€œ But if I can, yeah, I hope it can make it seemâ€Śuhh, not just cool butâ€Ś relevant â€Śyeah, thatâ€™s the wordâ€Śthe thing isâ€Śâ€
    â€œ I thought you wrote a Sex. Column.â€ he says with a powerful lack of inflection.
    I sigh. â€œ Yeah, I â€ŚI guess I still do butâ€Śâ€
    â€œItâ€™s a young-single-woman sorta column,â€ interjects Celeste, trying to be helpful. â€œ I mean now that sheâ€™s doing that thing whereâ€Śyou read the one whereâ€Śright?â€
    â€œNo,â€ I sigh. â€œ Itâ€™s a sex column. Orrrâ€Ś it was supposed to be. It used to be. You know. Moon Girls Are Easy. â€ â€
    â€œWhat?â€ Iâ€™m surprisingly delighted to trace the disgust in Phineasâ€™ flat, reedy voice. â€œItâ€™s called Earth Boys Are Easy . Donâ€™t bullshit me. I read them all, you know…â€
    â€œYou do?â€ Iâ€™m genuinely surprised and a little bit embarrassed by this.
    â€œWe both do.â€ Celeste nods factually, gulping her drink, colour indecipherable veiled in a hazy mauve tumbler glass.
    â€œReally?â€ Iâ€™m genuinely surprised.
    â€œYeah. If Phin hasnâ€™t seen the new one, I always send it to him.â€
    I suddenly worry that Iâ€™m being excluded from some closed email loop in the circle of siblings. Which, of course, I am, but it shouldnâ€™t worry me. I guess.
    I suddenly wish I had a foggy little drink just like Celesteâ€™s and look around hoping to order one. Weâ€™re on a patio deck, made of a granulose faux wood I am so familiar with it hurts, and yet which now seems so alien after only three, short years â€œdown onâ€ Earth that I can only feel ashamed of my displacement.
    â€œWell, they made me re-name it now Iâ€™m here,â€ I explain, deadpan as I have decided itâ€™s a damn stupid thing to have gotten so anguished about. â€œ Iâ€™m not allowed to quit. I have a contract.â€
    â€œWell but youâ€™re Up Here nowâ€Ś?â€ asks Celeste. â€œ Isnâ€™t thatâ€Śâ€
    â€œItâ€™s totally binding,â€ Phin interjects.
    â€œWell yeah, but they canâ€™t make you have sex, though,â€ says Lestie, unfortunately returning to the subject at hand. â€œJust to entertain them. Right? I mean you said you wereâ€Śumm…â€
    â€œ Itâ€™s a new angle,â€ Phin interpolates, leaning back in his blousy khakis, suddenly my translator as when we were little. For a person that doesnâ€™t, at core, understand me, he always intuitively knows how to speak for me in whatever way I exactly need. â€œSheâ€™s not gonna do any casual dating or have sex again or whatever until sheâ€™s in a committed and loving relationship that probably has a future,â€ he quotes verbatim from something I never actually said, I donâ€™t think, though I guess thatâ€™s, depressingly to a cum-hungry audience, it , in a nutshell.
    â€œYeahâ€Śâ€ Celeste agrees. â€œ That shit. Well thatâ€™s healthy, sis.â€ The way that someone would try to fake enthusiasm for your decision to become a vegan, or adopting an apple-a-day habit. â€œ And like now theyâ€™re letting you do this stuff soâ€Śâ€
    â€œ Yeah, itâ€™s good,â€ I monotone. â€œItâ€™s not so much theyâ€™re letting me,â€ I admit, â€œitâ€™s that Iâ€™m the only ORB1TAL staff within spitting distance of Lunaroo . â€ I squint at Celeste. â€œ And has a sister who works here.â€
    She shrugs. â€œ Donâ€™t hate the player, hate the game.â€
    â€œHey, remember how Ceci used to go out with that Ren Faire guy? Orâ€Ś that intergalactic rockstar dude who was in that huge ass band that was like a fucking orchestra?â€ Phin begins unhelpfully. I donâ€™t wince, and as for someone who hates being called even Cecil, much less Cecily, rather than Dalrymple, the address by the last name a nickname that feels like my first name by now, — only Phin and Celeste can get away with this. And I can see Iâ€™m in for the trading-cards sibs game of past relationships and columns that have made them laugh or kibbitz excessively, I now suspect.
    â€œOh yeah! That guy. He was way more entertaining than Ren Faire dude.â€
    â€œYeah. Why didnâ€™t you ever write a column about that?â€
    Thankfully, a waitress appears.
    â€œTheyâ€™re not here, Phin,â€ Celeste throws back. â€œTheyâ€™re touring Mars.â€ She rolls her eyes.
    â€œMy editor said talking about on again off again relationships was boring,â€ I say, though that isnâ€™t really the reason. Besides, that was Earth-years agoâ€Ślunar years, too. I decide not to even mention the ongoing tiresome car-crash of a text conversation Iâ€™ve been having with the denizens of the ORB1TAL mag office, or ORIFICE as we horrifyingly call it.
    { -Youâ€™ll be on the moon, you silly bint. Its not very on-brand is it?
    -Thereâ€™s men up there. On the moon. Same as bloody here. Send.
    Hopefully more there than anywhere, she replied churlishly.
    -You wouldnâ€™t know there were anybody dateable here of either sex just from reading your six inches.
    I winced, chewing my rogue left thumbnail. Please just fire me, I thought at her. Send.
    -But the contract is perfectly good and we are hoping if anything itâ€™ll juice things up — literally — a bit for you (cringe and double cringe, cringe cringe and cringe again).
    -Whatâ€™s the difference? I goaded her. – Moon Girl on Earth versus Moon Girl on the Moon. Not much of a difference there is there?…Iâ€™m a moon girl either wayâ€Ś Moon Girl on the Moon, I finally wrote.
    -Cracking, she texted, and for a second I thought she agreed.
    – Now thatâ€™s going in the right direction.
    Frack it.
    -MOON GIRLS ARE EASY —
    I threw the phone down on my lap in disgustâ€Ś}
    â€œYeah but itâ€™s perfect pitch for something called Earth Boys Are Easy , though, isnâ€™t it?â€ He flicks at his cuticles. â€œI mean they canâ€™t be touring Mars. What a load of bullshit. Neverrr liked that guy. That guy. What a lunatard. Like, no one tours Mars . No one but scientists and degenerates even GOES toâ€Śyou donâ€™t have entertainment on fucking Mars . Thatâ€™s a fantasy if I ever heard one.â€
    â€œHey how are your fucking stonks doing, Phin,â€ I fire back, referencing a short-lived teenage romance he himself once had had with the E-stock market. That thankfully flamed out when he was sixteen, after several miniscule, though much obsessively discussed, investments of his summer job money: at which point he did the sensible (to him) thing and joined the Armed Forces. He was an even weirder teenager than I was. If weâ€™re going to be playing this game.
    But finally, thankfully, capturing the attention of the waitress, Iâ€™m stunned by her uncanny, exact, rubbery resemblance to the stewardess back on the Air Apollo 7,787 Boring brand metro-lunar â€œJumbo Elephantâ€ AstroPlaneâ€Śa puffy-blonde whippet of a girl that is clearly ten years younger than I am — wide shouldered, angled wide, like a picture of a person with a faux-retro filter. Her blondey smoke-like puff of hair looming. Buffeting around in a fake wind they generate here in the land of the Biogesicdome.
    Like the stewardess who gave me my economy-section grade time-altering, time-cancelling pills and my waiver, she grins, big white teeth, Americana. Her eyes widen, gelly and loony blue.
    â€œYes?â€ she says in the same voice.
    â€œDid youâ€Śused to work for an airline? Like, yesterday?â€ I ask.
    She squints at me, understandably bored by yet another slow customer taking their infernal forever, eyes going static.
    â€œNo,â€ at length. â€œIâ€™ve always lived right here in Mare Vaporum!! Never even been on a plane.â€
    I can tell she is trying to seem light-hearted but is disconcerted by my obvious schizoish weirdness. Iâ€™m used to it. â€œCan I help youâ€Ś?â€
    I order the same thing Celeste is having, whatever that is, and try not to make any more eye contact.
    â€œYou know,â€ Phin begins — cracking his knuckles and firing up another companionable, somewhat offensive hobbyhorse with a laughing undertone that is not, at that, really amused, â€œ Itâ€™s like, Ceci is the last kind of person youâ€™d think of writing a sex column, right? Itâ€™s like if that thing people were obsessed with back in the post-Clintonian eraâ€Ś you know, that stupid Sex and the City thing that made them all uptight back when they had TeeVee, had been narrated by that Miranda one…â€
    â€œThat person looked exactly like someone I just saw,â€ I say, still struck, and ignoring Phin. And Celeste. Who has started up saying â€œyeah but sheâ€™s not a Miranda *sexually * is she though?…â€ talking about me just as he is doing, as if I am not here. But I am relatively used to it given that my job is to make myself something of a public commodity, and, besides that, my brother and sister have been talking about me and each other more or less that way since always.
    â€œ Iâ€™d swear itâ€™s herâ€Ś. Or her evil twin. Or elseâ€Śtheyâ€™re all robots.â€
    â€œThereâ€™s no robots yet,â€ says Lestie, grinning. â€œOr Iâ€™d sure be out of a job.â€
    She then adopts a careful tone I am also used to. â€œ You know, sometimes Inter-LEO travel can make you a little…Iâ€™ve read…you knowâ€Ś iffy . Maybe you need more rest.â€
    At that point I decide not to tell them my anecdote about the Arcade at the Nectarian Hotel, and how I found those weird old code strings at the centre of the old Tetronikon game — neither of them had ever played Tetronikon with Dad, or been interested in the Rubokon level, or hacking the centre or any of that old gamer nerd stuffâ€Ś even as kids werenâ€™t even a little intrigued to know you could be able to hide what could be real sensitive information in the centre of what is, essentially, a public domain multi-player video game. We were all in tacit and silent agreement that I was never to talk about what Dad had done for a living, as I knew that they had, essentially, sided with Mom, as if it had been Mom against the specter of the state, against the Service itself, a kind of magical thinking where Dad had almost been a victim of magical thinking himself; indeed as if the eighty-five percent of his life in which he struggled stressfully and traveled away from us for work had been, in turn, some kind of psychotic delusion of his own. It was so nice really, to be back together again in our little trio in what passed for soft, precious comity between us, and I didnâ€™t want to fuck that up by bringing up Dadâ€™s enthusiasms, or allying my own weirdo mind with his, despite that they both knew it was allied. His ability to see all those patterns…maybe too many patterns, just like I was flagrantly displaying now, I guess. With something that was, even I would have to admit, kind of nuts. The stewarâ€ŚI meanâ€Śwaitress, comes back with my drink and I smile and tip her, like a normal humanoid being.
    Even now though, I have to admit, I am catching myself scanning the expanse before us, without even really noticing that Iâ€™m doing it. Iâ€™m checking for abnormalities within an otherwise sedate crowd, just as he taught me to do without thinking. But I stop and refocus and I get Phin with surprising ease onto a more palatable conversational track, asking him about his life in the Forces manning tanks and all that wild shit, letting the calmness of sitting in a biofield wash over me as the alcohol buffers through my system in the ersatz summer day, and he drones soothingly on about how unlike a tank on Earth, it needs to be sealed up airtight at all times, especially as thereâ€™s no air to take in, and so thatâ€™s a good thing as well because itâ€™s harder for all that corrosive dust to get in. And furthermore, how he likes to play pranks on his tank mates by changing the view screen through which they view everything all the time —being that they canâ€™t, of course, have any windows or periscopes out there lest it render a hole in the armour — to random things sometimes just to freak them out. â€œNot when weâ€™re doing manoeuvres,â€ he laughs, â€œIâ€™m not, yâ€™know, a complete asshole.â€ I avoid the subject Iâ€™ve been so carefully avoiding writing about for his sake alone for two years, that of the Earth draft and all who oppose it (like me) and who donâ€™t (like him, paradoxically enough). And I especially donâ€™t want to mention that I know there are encampments of draft dodgers here on the strawberry fields, handing out their pamphlets and the like.
    I watch the first sad attempt on the Beltcore platform, screaming and hair whipping around the stage in an angry progression of the alienation of GreyMetal to the despair and paranoia of ProgGrok. Heâ€™s hopping in a bizarre kind of energetic circle that looks ceremonial but isnâ€™t, as it canâ€™t be, just another stab at a lunar identity that ends and begins at confusion. Or that, at least is what Iâ€™m going to say in my Lunaroo review.
    Celeste is just one of those people who must have had the, well, celestial grace to have been born enlightened. Once you realise that enlightenment is really that flow state of living carelessly and sensually in the moment, you can realise that if you are any sort of — well, condemned to a theorising disposition, I donâ€™t want to say a sophist — that you are doomed, and your mind and life is already fucked. Unless you can change your central disposition, which is next to impossible without major trauma, and even then. But growing up with Celeste as my counterpart I donâ€™t even have to consider this to get a look in at the paradox, a luxury of its own making â€“ Celeste is alive, while I am a gloomy ghost who leaches from a perma-collapsing perspective. Or to put it a less nihilistic way, I think too much, donâ€™t I, and what am I like â€Ś while Celeste, for her part, isnâ€™t certain she even believes in her own happiness despite that it continually accosts other people like thrown darts.
    Or if she believes in happiness at all. Which is, probably, healthy. If we stopped believing in it, I always think, well, weâ€™d stop being toyed with and tortured by its hungry-ghost like absence anyway.
    If you ask my sister if she is happy sheâ€™ll talk about something that happened just today, and something that maybe just happened that made her dissatisfied. She is, like most people who live in the moment, eternally dissatisfied while at the same time extremely engaged and in a sort of candy floss paradise of thoughts that are less energising and more sort of buoyant, a hive of feelings and nerves that keep her floating onwards and upwards, and she as complex as any one atom is in its placement in this web, always balanced by the volume of the energy mass itselfâ€Śa revolving world of Celeste. Apposite, her name, really, singled out for her cosmos, the metaphysical opposite of an Internet Of Things. She is, or at least protectively appears to be, Daisy Buchananâ€™s wise natal prophecy.
    Sheâ€™ll make a whining sound, because she genuinely feels my pain. Even when I canâ€™t, which is usually. Like now. â€œYouâ€™ve been on Earth too long,â€ she asserts, her tendrilly hands trespassing in my tendrilly hair.
    â€œIts gone all weird and texture-y because of the atmospheric change. Sucked the moisture right out. Can I highlight it?â€ she asks.
    â€œI donâ€™t think we can do that here…? Weâ€™re camping.â€
    â€œI have a hairspray that can do it.â€
    She wants to help me achieve literal enlightenment. Her shade of dark blonde mouse differs from my shade of dark blonde vole naturally by two levels; artificially, by at least three. I consider that if I let Celeste re- aestheticize me, it could act as a sort of placebo —the kind of thing we did when we were girls, instant twins, bright colours and another personâ€™s tight skin bracing my spine for a new day of fake jubilance that, like wine, drunk, might eventually turn the light up on the day as semi-permanently as my frosted hair. â€˜Snap ready. The Re-Branding of the Shrew.
    â€œSo that review stuffâ€Ś how much do you have to write?â€ she asks, her breath heavy with clove, mint and those coolers we have been drinking since we were Earth-16.
    Like a lot of people, and like Vnessa, our mother, Lestie says Earth in that slight way, with that slight accent, that slant that without meaning to says to me:
    – Itâ€™s such a shame to be such a snob, to betray us with that place what thinks its fucking much better than us Up Hereâ€Ś Like Vnessa, so openly hostile, Whyâ€™dja hafta move to Earth is it that you just want to get away from us sooo baaaadd? Egotistical just like your faaatheerr — well itâ€™s that kinda tone. As if I was, you know actually wanted around them, for some reason I have yet to fathom or been informed of. But the principle of the guilt trip canâ€™t allow for such criticism.
    On principle, some Mooners wonâ€™t even go to Earth if you paid them, as seen on the reality show Lunatic Immigrants which is either binge watched or hated by everyone from Taurus-Littrow to Timbuktu. And its even more extreme sister show, HoneyMooners , following the arranged marriages of inter-stellar couples and trying so hard to avenge the stereotype of the mail-order Moonwife that it paradoxically has re-incarnated it for a whole new generation. It seems like this should be an old- fashioned attitude, especially if you consider that hardly anyone can trace back their own families four generations. Certainly not ours, with Dad half the time on a literal mission mode back and forth from the Green Bin of his birth, answering only to a very Terra Forma sort of government indeed. I think about my passport now, interplanetary with an A-1 Interplanetary Class passport-holder with a shiny switch-visa implanted into the thick skin of my dark blue leatherite wallet. I know itâ€™s not remotely the same, as my work isnâ€™t remotely similar and he had a whole range of passports styled in ways that I couldnâ€™t even imagine, but itâ€™s a little badge of displacement, homelessness even, yet another thing that skewers me even farther away from Celeste, who would never want to carry that. Who would make a thing out of not.
    So it gets my hackles up, I guess, when I hear Earth even though for all youâ€™d know in the last three years of living there I wouldnâ€™t swing the bloody place so farâ€™s I can measure what, to quote Vnessaâ€™s backwards lower Fra Mauro sociolect. Itâ€™s that tone that makes me think of the old, famous Marius Hills suburban mallrat stereotype that groomed and styled and raised up Celeste and me, both figuratively and in literal form in our competitive, heavily vehicular armoured Vnessa.
    I wonder if it makes me squirm mostly in my own feeling of shame that Iâ€™ll never, could never quite fit into that mirror, so maybe, like, what, my whole life is an exercise in thwarting it? Well, hardly. Well, maybe . Or maybe a guilt on my own heart, a traitor, the curse of the literal cosmopolitan, and the one thing that keeps throwing me, accusingly in the eyes of my siblings, back into the shadow of Dad over either of them two. But you canâ€™t help who you take after.
    But the lilty little accent is like a virus that hacks on swimmingly inside Celeste. I suddenly wish I still had it, that I hadnâ€™t got â€œLBC Englishâ€ -itis back in uni, or so everyone told me. Having been a Terrist for three whole e-years, too, wouldnâ€™t that have sawed off those edges and hacked its heart to pieces, as aâ€Śwell.
    Suddenly self- conscious in a whole new way, at last I stop ruminating and dare to ask Lestie: â€œUm, do I â€Śsound really, really weird now? Since Iâ€™ve been living Off, â€Śyou know?â€
    â€œYep,â€ she said. â€œBut you always kinda did, because you listened to all that E-rock shit.â€
    â€œ It was just Dadâ€™s records, at firstâ€Śâ€ I said, my long spine stiffening. â€œAnd itâ€™s not likeâ€Śâ€ I gesture to the main stage, which weâ€™re approaching in the distance. The humidity, different than earthly humidity, a deep artificial temperature coiled around my waist like a snake; itâ€™s getting to me now, and I remove my extraneous layer, aware that I was silly to even put on anything over the tank top. â€œThey’re playing a song called â€œ Earthless, â€ right now,â€ I say, watching my feet making almost inaudible crunching sounds, inaudible over the huge span of the music and the high frequency speaker-crackling of a mass of people gathered here to peacefully riot. â€œOh yeah donâ€™t you love this song? I mean I used to, but it started getting in my head all the damn timeâ€Śâ€
    â€œYeah no kidding. How many more times can you rhyme â€œEarthlessâ€ with â€œworthless…â€ I respond. â€œPlus itâ€™s almost like they took the hook from that Laika song and just looped it around unti — â€
    I donâ€™t get any further than that, and the song itself stops, blown away by a blast that almost busts my eardrums, throws my face up against the dark red grass, so that I have to cough violently to avoid inhaling lungfuls of dirt. I struggle across the ground, looking for Lestie in a cloud of dust, pulling my tank top over my face, finally grasping hold of her shoulders on the ground next to me. I can hear her screaming something indecipherable but I try my best to filter it out, even though it is, at the same time, the sound that most terrifies and most comforts me, being that its Lestieâ€™s voice and itâ€™s the sound of her kicking and screaming.
    â€œCome on we have to get up —- â€ I yell shrilly in her ear. I drag her up against waves of people already running, the colours of their clothes more up in my face than they were in the mosh pit, yet obscured through the dust mist and the still heavy dead space of heat.

Of course, Iron Ore prices could rise a lot higher which would make ZIOC even more of a steal.

    text: "Software listings remain a sweet spot within the technology sector, which has fared better than any other through the coronavirus pandemic this year Share Via Unity Technologies Snowflake Asana
    Silicon Valley software notables -- Unity Technologies Inc., Snowflake Inc. and Asana Inc. -- are set to disclose their financials as soon as next week ahead of September trading debuts, according to people familiar with their plans.
    Palantir Technologies Inc., which also is planning to go public in late September through a direct listing, is nearing disclosure of its financial results and other details of its business, said people familiar with that matter, who like the others asked not to be identified because the companies’ plans were private.
    It’s shaping up to be one of the busiest falls ever in the U.S. for venture-backed technology exits on the stock market. Adding to the spate of upcoming listings, Airbnb Inc. said it has filed its IPO registration confidentially with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The long-awaited IPO could happen as soon as the fourth quarter, people familiar with the company’s plans have said.
    Software listings remain a sweet spot within the technology sector, which has fared better than any other through the coronavirus pandemic this year. The 18 companies in the space that have gone public on U.S. exchanges this year have climbed about 91% since their debut on a weighted-average basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Overall, newly listed companies excluding blank-check firms and real estate investment trusts have risen only 52% since their IPOs, the data show.
    Unity, a developer of software used to design video games, will seek to be valued at more than $10 billion in a listing next month, said people familiar with the matter. Its shares are now trading above that mark on the secondary market, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    Snowflake is expected to be valued at perhaps far more than $10 billion in an IPO, one of the people said. The Financial Times reported the valuation could be as high as $20 billion. a rep
    Asana, which is planning to bypass a traditional IPO through a direct listing next month, has been trading on the secondary market at a value of about $5 billion, Bloomberg News previously reported. The secondary market valuation is an important element of a company’s price discovery process in a direct listing, because no new shares are sold.
    Representatives for Unity and Asana didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for snowflake declined to comment.
    Palantir, according to people with knowledge of its confidentially filed listing documents, lost $579 million on revenue of $742 million in 2019. Palantir reported $488 million in revenue during the first six months of 2020, an amount expected to be higher in the second half of the year because the company has historically booked roughly 60% of revenue during the fourth quarter when government contracts are finalized, said one of the people.

    The Next Global Depression is Coming and Optimism Won’t Slow It Down
    The world is confused and frightened. COVID-19 infections are on the rise across the U.S. and around the world, even in countries that once thought they had contained the virus. The outlook for the next year is at best uncertain; countries are rushing to produce and distribute vaccines at breakneck speeds, some opting to bypass critical phase trials. Meanwhile, unemployment numbers remain dizzyingly high, even as the U.S. stock market continues to defy gravity. We’re headed into a global depression–a period of economic misery that few living people have experienced. A depression is not a period of uninterrupted economic contraction. There can be periods of temporary progress within it that create the appearance of recovery. The Great Depression of the 1930s began with the stock-market crash of October 1929 and continued into the early 1940s, when World War II created the basis for new growth. That period included two separate economic drops: first from 1929 to 1933, and then again from May 1937 into 1938. As in the 1930s, we’re likely to see moments of expansion in this period of depression. First, the current slowdown is without doubt global. Most postwar U.S. recessions have limited their worst effects to the domestic economy. But most were the result of domestic inflation or a tightening of national credit markets. That is not the case with COVID-19 and the current global slowdown. This is a synchronized crisis, and just as the relentless rise of China over the past four decades has lifted many boats in richer and poorer countries alike, so slowdowns in China, the U.S. and Europe will have global impact on our globalized world. This coronavirus has ravaged every major economy in the world. Its impact is felt everywhere. Social safety nets are now being tested as never before. Some will break. Health care systems, particularly in poorer countries, are already buckling under the strain. As they struggle to cope with the human toll of this slowdown, governments will default on debt. For all these reasons, middle-income and developing countries are especially vulnerable, but the debt burdens and likelihood of defaults will pressure the entire global financial system. The second defining characteristic of a depression: the economic impact of COVID-19 will cut deeper than any recession in living memory. The monetary-policy report submitted to Congress in June by the Federal Reserve noted that the “severity, scope, and speed of the ensuing downturn in economic activity have been significantly worse than any recession since World War II.” Payroll employment fell an unprecedented 22 million in March and April before adding back 7.5 million jobs in May and June. The unemployment rate jumped to 14.7% in April, the highest level since the Great Depression, before recovering to 11.1% in June. These factors lead us toward the third definition of depression: a slowdown that will last longer than recessions of the past 80 years. The Congressional Budget Office has warned that the unemployment rate will remain stubbornly high for the next decade, and economic output will remain depressed for years unless changes are made to the way government taxes and spends. Those sorts of changes will depend on broad recognition that emergency measures won’t be nearly enough to restore the U.S. economy to health. What’s true in the U.S. will be true everywhere else. [Source: Time]
    Despite governments trying to paint a V-shaped in a post Covid-19 world, the reality is much worse. A global depression is very likely and will sweep the world. This also means that more and more people will question whether Capitalism can continue for the foreseeable future. At this juncture, Muslims must take it upon themselves to portray Islam as the only alternative to crooked Capitalism.
    Bahrain, Oman could be next to Normalize Relations with Israel. Saudi Arabia? Not so fast
    The deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates to establish diplomatic relations could lead other countries in the region to carve out their own plans, but it’s unlikely that Saudi Arabia, arguably the most important geo-political Gulf state, will follow suit anytime soon, according to experts who specialize in the region. Whether any other Persian Gulf state follows the U.A.E.’s lead will first depend upon the domestic reaction and reaction across the Arab world to the agreement, said Dov Waxman, director of UCLA’s Y&S Nazarian Center for Israel Studies. Autocratic leaders in the Gulf, who are facing economic challenges and can be sensitive to public opinion, might hesitate if there is a major uproar, Waxman said. Still, it’s a watershed moment in Israel’s relationship with Gulf Arab states which have been happy to have quiet, so-called under the table dealings with Israel until now, he said. “The U.A.E.’s willingness to go public with this and fully normalize relations is a historic breakthrough in that respect,” Waxman said from Los Angeles. And it is significant, he said, because “now that the U.A.E. has taken the first step, taken the plunge, so to speak, it will encourage other countries to follow.” Now, with the U.A.E. deal in place, some experts predict Bahrain and Oman could be next to forge agreements of their own. “Countries are very influenced by their neighbours, especially their neighbour who are seen to be in relatively similar situations,” said William F. Wechsler, senior adviser for Middle East programs at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C. In the case of Oman, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Oman’s Sultan Qaboos bin Said in a very public meeting that was broadcast across the country in 2018. But following Qaboos’ death earlier this year, and with a relatively new sultan having just assumed power, a deal with Israel may have to wait, Wechsler said. As for a deal with Saudi Arabia, that would be seen as the “jewel in the crown,” and their willingness to normalize relations with Israel would be the most critical development in terms of changing Israel’s relationship with the Arab world, according to Waxman. But Waxman said he would be surprised if that happened any time soon. He described Saudi foreign policy as a bit more cautious. [Source: CBC News].
    The Jewish state is a crusader project and will remain as such no matter how hard the rulers of the Gulf try to normalize relations the Jewish state. Just as Salahuddin liberated Jerusalem from the crusaders in the 12 th century, the impending Caliphate will do the same.
    Threat of Atomic Weapons Grows as U.S., Russia and China Renew Arms Race
    Seventy-five years after the dropping of the first atomic bomb in Hiroshima, one nuclear non-proliferation after the other is lapsing. A new arms race is already taking shape between Russia, the United States and China. It’s not very difficult for an industrialized country to build a nuclear bomb. The technology is already available, and it’s astonishing that more countries haven’t done it so far. The veto powers on the United Nations Security Council – the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain – all have nuclear weapons, as do Israel, India and Pakistan. Beyond that, there’s North Korea and perhaps also soon Iran. Many worry that the proliferation of nuclear weapons could spin out of control. But those worries apparently don’t go deep enough. Fears of nuclear war more or less disappeared after the Cold War and they haven’t returned since. The nuclear weapons of the world’s major powers seem to be in a state of slumber deep within their silos, like mythical creatures from a distant past. That impression, however, is deceptive. In recent years, one disarmament treaty after the other has been dismantled, including the nuclear deal with Iran, the INF treaty banning land-based, medium-range weapons, the Open Skies Treaty, which guarantees countries mutual reconnaissance flights – all terminated by U.S. President Donald Trump. The New START treaty on strategically offensive weapons is also about to expire. “We are returning to the days of the 1950s and 1960s, when each country decided for itself how many and what kind of weapons to deploy,” says Vienna-based disarmament expert Nikolai Sokov. The Washington Post recently reported that Trump is considering conducting new nuclear tests in Nevada. The decommissioned test site there is still littered with craters left behind by around a thousand underground detonations – all traces of the Cold War. A new test would be a clear indication that, after three decades of silence, a new nuclear age is dawning. Meanwhile, Moscow is also tinkering with devices that seem to come straight out of a Cold War science fiction film. Last year, seven people died when a nuclear-powered cruise missile apparently exploded during an attempted salvage operation in the White Sea. A nuclear mega-torpedo is also under development that could wipe out coastal cities with artificial tsunamis. And in the shadow of the two major nuclear powers of U.S. and Russia, China is expanding its arsenal, unbound by the old arms control treaties. [Source: Der Spiegel International]
    It is very unlikely that a renewed nuclear arms race will destabilize the world and lead to a nuclear apocalypse. The concept of mutual assured destruction (MAD) will ensure that ration prevails at the time of crisis. MAD has worked for 75 years and nuclear peace has prevailed ever since. There is no reason to suspect that MAD will fail as great powers compete for nuclear supremacy in the 21 st century.",

    US biotech Inozyme Pharma is the latest to jump on to the IPO bandwagon, setting terms for a $75 million stock market launch, as the firm gears up for clinical trials of its lead drug for rare bone diseases.
    Based in Boston, Massachusetts, the company plans to raise $75 million by offering 5 million shares at a price range of $14 to $16.
    This is at the midpoint of the proposed range, where Inozyme Pharma could command a fully diluted market value of $332 million.
    Founded in 2015, Inozyme wants to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol INZY.
    Boston, Massachusetts-based Inozyme’s lead candidate is INZ-701, a soluble, genetically engineered protein designed to correct a defect in the mineralisation pathway.
    The company plans to file for approval to begin clinical trials in the US and Europe in the second half of this year, followed by phase 1/2 trials.
    With INZ-701, the company is targeting a variety of mineralisation disorders linked mainly to mutations in the ENPP1 and ABCC6 genes.
    The drug is designed to replace the lost enzymatic function of deficient ENPP1 by restoring normal balance in pyrophosphate.
    It is designed to be delivered subcutaneously and to linger in the system, leading to steady concentrations in the blood over time and making dosing possible at infrequent intervals, possibly weekly.
    The COVID-19 pandemic has seen biotech stocks becoming increasingly popular with investors, allowing unlisted biotechs to raise large sums with stock market launches.
    Last month Royalty Pharma set Wall Street on fire with its oversubscribed $2.2 billion IPO, selling 77 million shares.
    The IPO raised around $300 million more than expected and shares surged after the debut, surging 59% on the first day of trading to close at $44.50.
    As its name suggests Royalty Pharma is the largest player in the niche area of pharmaceutical royalty agreements.
    The company’s revenues all come from royalty payments resulting from rights it holds to experimental or marketed drugs, either acquired from other developers or resulting from funding contributions to development programmes.

By John Divine , Senior Investing Reporter July 20, 2020 By John Divine , Senior Investing Reporter July 20, 2020, at 5:51 p.m. With a 7.9% jump, Amazon was one of the Nasdaq's heavy hitters that soared on Monday.

    In what was arguably one of 2020’s starkest days of contrast for markets, technology stocks continued to rip and roar higher on Monday, led once again by many of the largest names in Silicon Valley.
    Eight of the 11 stock market sectors actually finished lower for the day, but not the information technology sector, which surged 2.6% over the course of trading.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished essentially flat on the day, up less than 9 points, or less than 0.1%, while the Nasdaq rallied 2.5%, adding 263 points to finish at 10,767. [ Sign up for stock news with our Invested newsletter. ]
    Ant IPO … but not in the U.S. The big seemed to get bigger on Monday, and Alibaba (ticker: BABA ) was no exception. The Chinese e-commerce giant – which has parlayed its dominance into an enviable portfolio of leading services in finance, ride-sharing, cloud computing and other high-growth industries – took a 33% stake in Ant Group in 2018.
    At the time, the parent company of online payments company Alipay was considered one of the hottest private-market investments in fintech. In 2020, little has changed, and Ant Group is reportedly seeking to publicly list shares on two Chinese and Hong Kong-based exchanges, bypassing the U.S. market entirely. XNYS: BABA | 4:00:00 PM",

Even after having premium subscription the app video streaming is just too bad which is ideally the basic need of this app. Why does it has to be reinstalled again and even after reinstalling again the same issue rises. And this issue is not faced by 1 or 2 people. Almost all users are facing the same problem. So problem is definitely at the application server level. Kindly resolve this issue or the users will start to reduce. This may also reduce your stock market value.",

No, it's way more than that for the millions of people that have 401-k and IRA investments based on stock markets. It is sharply discounted from the economy....? what does that mean?

I point out the ones doing really well are the billionaire, aristocratic tech companies, but you’re too dumb to understand because of the tropes you’ve been taught to regurgitate. So either billionaires are bad for hoarding wealth and hurting the working class, or pound your chest because these are the “industries associated with democrats”. Pick one.",

    text: "https://www.globalresearch.ca/what-truly-verifiable-facts-surrounding-covid-19/5721128
    By David Skripac Global Research, August 14, 2020
    “Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”
    Those words, uttered by two-time Nobel Prize-winning chemist and physicist Marie Curie , are as relevant today as they were in her era (1867–1934). With most of the planet under some form of medical martial law, we would do well to follow her advice: understand more and fear less about the pandemic. The way to do that is to establish the verifiable, scientific facts about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and separate those facts from the fiction being touted by a fear-mongering news media. Only then will we stop surrendering our inherent freedoms to COVID-19 propaganda.
    Fiction #1: Wearing a face mask will protect you and others from the coronavirus.
    Fact #1: Contrary to what many medical and government officials tell us, there is no evidence to support the claim that face masks—whether N95, surgical, or cloth—protect the wearer from any virus. These so-called “medical experts” usually reference a purportedly scientific publication to support their claim. However, when the studies they point to—namely, in The Lancet and from the Mayo Clinic —are put under closer scrutiny, they fail to pass one crucial test: they never used a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Reputable scientists consider the RCT the Holy Grail when it comes to conducting a study on a large group of people, because it eliminates the possibility of any population bias in the testing.
    When we look at trials that have used the RCT method to analyze the efficacy of face masks, we find starkly different results from those that have not.
    For instance, an exhaustive dental study conducted in 2016 revealed that disposable surgical face masks are incapable of providing protection from respiratory pathogens.
    Then there was the study conducted this past February by Long Y, Hu T, Liu, et al., titled “Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza.” It involved a total of six RCTs and 9,171 participants. The study concluded that “the current meta-analysis shows the use of N95 compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza. It suggests that N95 respirators should not be recommended for general public and nonhigh-risk medical staffs those are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients.”
    Even the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has done studies on face masks by correctly using RCTs. In one report , titled “Emerging Infectious Diseases, Vol.26, No.5” and published in May 2020, the CDC did ten Randomized Controlled Trials before concluding, “Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect against accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids. There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure. Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”
    As for those people who wear a cloth mask in the belief that “it’s better than wearing nothing,” a RCT conducted in 2015 showed that cloth masks do not work at all. In actuality, a cloth mask puts the wearer at increased risk of respiratory illness and viral infections.
    In light of the plethora of available science on face masks, it is heartening to see that some governments are making rational decisions based on that science. In the Netherlands, for example, officials are refusing to mandate mask-wearing in public .
    In the end, the face mask should be viewed as a device used by authoritarians to control the masses and enforce compliance to lawless edicts. The mask lulls wearers into feeling protected from biological harm. Meanwhile, the real harm being done to them is psychological and spiritual. By submitting to mandatory face-covering orders based on flawed science and imposed by either unelected-but-politicized medical officials and technocrats or elected-but-compromised politicians who hold positions in all levels of government—these mask wearers don’t realize that they’re handing over their precious liberties, their individuality, and even, one might say, their very souls to soulless tyrants.
    Fiction #2: Scientists have isolated and purified the SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus.
    Fact #2 : To date, not a single team of scientists has isolated and purified the SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus. Some researchers claim to have done so. But when their findings are scrutinized, they fall short. Just as Randomized Controlled Trials are required to do accurate studies of the efficacy and safety of medical devices like face masks or products such as prescription drugs, so, too, is there a major benchmark that must be satisfied if one is to prove that he has indeed correctly identified and isolated a virus. That benchmark has been, since 1890, a set of principals known as the Koch postulates , named after famed German physician and bacteriologist Robert Koch. All researchers must apply his four postulates if they are to prove or disprove a cause-and-effect relationship between a pathogen and a particular clinical disease.
    For example, in February 2020, Chinese and Dutch researchers published studies purporting to show that they had isolated the SARS-CoV-2 virus by satisfying all of the Koch postulates. Four months later, however, freelance writer Armory Devereux and molecular biologist and researcher Rosemary Frei revealed the truth about those studies in an Off-Guardian article. Their heavily investigated and well-documented piece confirms that the Chinese and Dutch researchers did not fulfill Koch’s third postulate, which involves replicating or cloning the DNA to form a new copy of the virus and then injecting that new copy into a significant number of living hosts (usually lab animals) with the intent to reproduce the same discrete diagnostic symptoms associated with the virus. In fact, Frei discovered, after reviewing numerous research papers from all over the world, that not a single group of scientists was able to replicate or clone the DNA to form a new copy of the virus. In short, they failed to meet Koch’s third postulate.
    Another team of investigative journalists, Torsten Engelbrecht and Konstantin Demeter, wrote an equally comprehensive article on the same subject for Off-Guardian . They, too, concluded that there is not a single research paper out there demonstrating that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been successfully isolated and finally purified. In addition, Engelbrecht and Demeter discovered that “there is no scientific proof that those RNA sequences are the causative agent of what is called COVID-19.”
    In other words, by not successfully fulfilling all of Koch’s postulates, scientists have thus far not proven the existence of any new coronavirus. This is why molecular biologist Dr. Andrew Kaufman has suggested in numerous interviews—on The Highwire and The Last American Vagabond and elsewhere—that the current coronavirus is not a new disease. Dr. Kaufman submits, moreover, that the particles scientists say they are looking at through their electron microscopes are perhaps not the virus at all but are, rather, exosomes being produced by the body. These exosomes, containing the same genetic material as a virus, are naturally produced by the human body as a defense mechanism in response to an external attack by a toxin emanating from our polluted environment. This would be a possible explanation as to why the “pandemic” started in China’s Wuhan province. This area of China is one of the most polluted places on earth. In Wuhan, the ecosystem in all its glorious biodiversity has been utterly destroyed by man-made pollutants and the heavy use of glyphosate in industrial farming.
    Besides pollution, there is yet another plausible explanation as to why this particular coronavirus (if it exists, which some reputable experts highly doubt) may have possibly started in Wuhan. The internationally funded Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has proven financial ties to the US government and is known for its poor safety standards, was involved in dangerous gain-of-function research to make bat viruses more lethal to humans. Several disturbing studies conducted by the lab “successfully” combined animal and human virus traits in ways that made them more dangerous to humans. This description of the institute’s research raises many questions. At present, there is not enough evidence to prove whether a pathogen was either intentionally released by the lab or was accidentally leaked into the environment. And, even if a virus was intentionally released into the environment as a bioweapon, the developers of this weapon did not do a good job. As we will see in the last fiction versus fact (below), this coronavirus has had virtually the same global infection fatality rate as the average seasonal flu. If anything, the influenza virus of 2017 was far more lethal than this year’s coronavirus.
    Finally, this brings us to the multi-billion-dollar question on the virus isolation issue: If scientists have not properly identified the virus or the RNA gene sequences associated with the virus, how on earth are the vaccine companies developing a mRNA vaccine against a novel coronavirus, and what exactly will be in this vaccine? Perhaps this is why the initial vaccine trials conducted by biotech company Moderna, the US vaccine front-runner, and AstraZeneca, which leads the British Oxford Vaccine Group, have been unsatisfactory .
    Fiction #3: The Reverse Transcriptase quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) test is the best way to diagnose a patient with COVID-19.
    Fact #3 : The PCR test, which is currently being used by every nation to test for COVID-19, was initially designed by Nobel Prize-winning biochemist Kary Mullis . From its inception, the PCR was, and still is, a thermal cycling method used to replicate billions of copies of a specific DNA sample. Simply put, the PCR makes the DNA large enough so that scientists can study it. Although Mullis unexpectedly passed away in August 2019, we know what his thoughts were when it came to using his test as a diagnostic tool, thanks to an invaluable interview he did in 1994 with investigative journalist Celia Farber. The interview leaves no doubt that Mullis argued against using the PCR as a diagnostic tool for detecting viruses.
    Granted, the PCR test is capable of detecting even the minutest piece of DNA or RNA, but this is meaningless if scientists have not determined what specific RNA sequences they are actually searching for. And, in light of Fact #2, which established that no correct isolation and purification of the presumed virus has been executed, the PCR test is scientifically illogical.
    That the PCR test is being misused, either unwittingly or wittingly hence fraudulently, on COVID-19 diagnoses cannot be overstated. According to the aforementioned Off-Guardian article by Torsten Engelbrecht, “it is worth mentioning that the PCR tests used to identify so-called COVID-19 patients presumably infected by what is called SARS-CoV-2 do not have a valid gold standard to compare them with. This is a fundamental point. Tests need to be validated to determine their ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity’—by comparison to a ‘gold standard,’ meaning the most accurate method available.” Engelbrecht makes clear that, to date, there is no valid gold standard for the PCR test because, thus far, no one has isolated and purified the alleged virus. Only unequivocal proof of the existence of a new SARS-CoV-2 can be considered the gold standard.
    Therefore, it should come as no surprise when we find that the PCR test is plagued with outcomes that can indicate “false negatives” of up to 20 percent or “false positives” of up to an outrageous 70 percent ! Both the US CDC and the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) are well aware that the PCR test has some major pitfalls. The CDC, for instance, states that “this test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.” Meanwhile, the FDA has reviewed and summarised, for Accelerated Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) purposes, Laboratory Corporation of America’s LabCorp COVID-19 RT-PCR test and has slapped on it a warning label: “This test has not been FDA cleared or approved.” In the same summary, the FDA explains that “the agent detected may not be the definite cause of the disease.”
    Given everything we now know about the inaccuracy of the PCR test, why is the World Health Organization (WHO) still insisting that every nation continue testing as many people as possible with this method?
    Could it be because the entire narrative about the “pandemic” is riding on the distorted PCR test results?
    Could it also be that the very high “false positive” rate perfectly fits an agenda of inflating the infection case numbers (not the mortality numbers) so as to instill fear into the minds and hearts of as many people as possible?
    Could it be that injecting fear into the population enables the technocrats and their pawns to continue the draconian stay-at-home lockdowns and economically devastating business shutdowns and the ridiculous containment measures (such as physical distancing) and other punitive restrictions (e.g., fourteen-day quarantines after travel, even when the travel is a simple car trip between adjoining US states)? Could it be that they are purposely placing the lives of millions of people under enormous stress and in precipitous poverty?
    Is this all part of a behavior modification process that will make it easier for social engineers (technocrats) to completely redesign society so that the distribution of all goods and services to the entire population and the consumption of energy by that population will be orchestrated by a select few self-appointed “experts”?
    Technocracy News & Trends’ researcher/writer Patrick Wood lays out a plausible explanation for this scenario in his recent interview withDr. Joseph Mercola. In it, Wood notes that the technocracy movement, which started in the early twentieth century, “was always an economic movement, not a political system.” The destruction of the global economy, the removal of everyone’s inherent freedoms, the elimination of national sovereignty, and the accumulation of layers and layers of rules and regulations based on unsubstantiated science are ingredients that constitute the perfect recipe for any technocrat whose goal is to completely redesign society and implement an entirely new economic system.
    Fiction #4 : A “second wave” of new COVID-19 cases has already started in the United States.
    Fact #4 : There is no “second wave” of COVID-19 cases, nor will there be a “third wave.”
    Sure, at first glance, it would appear that states like South Carolina, Nevada, Florida, Texas, Arizona, and California are indeed experiencing a huge surge in new COVID-19 cases. Upon second glance, though, we find two factors that explain this unnatural phenomenon.
    First, what the media assiduously avoids mentioning is that in June these very same states undertook major campaigns to screen a vast swath of their populace with the PCR test—a viral assay that is employed not as an accurate diagnostic tool but, rather, as a means of inflating positive case counts.
    While it is true that not all of the positive cases fall into the category of “false positive,” it is equally true, as Fact #2 makes clear, that the PCR assay detects even the minutest particle of RNA associated with any virus. Thus, the test can detect people who have developed antibody T-cells to any previous coronavirus or who are asymptomatic. Either way, these individuals are automatically classified as COVID-19 cases. How convenient for the pandemic-pushers! Such a generous classification means that even those patients undergoing elective surgery who happen to test positive during the hospital admission process are categorised as “hospitalised with COVID-19.”
    John Thomas Littell , MD, a family physician in Ocala, Florida, wrote an astute letter to the editor of the Orlando Medical News , in which he perfectly summarises the COVID-19 data manipulation:
    “So, in essence, any person with an influenza-like illness (ILI) could be considered a ‘case’ of COVID-19, even WITHOUT confirmatory lab testing. The CDC has even advised to consider any deaths from pneumonia or ILI as ‘COVID-related’ deaths—unless the physician or medical examiner establishes another infectious agent as the cause of illness.
    “Now perhaps you see why the increasing number of cases, and even deaths, due to COVID-19 is fraught with misinterpretation and is NOT in any way a measure of the ACTUAL morbidity and mortality FROM COVID-19.”
    Second, the news media rarely, if ever, mentions the all-important point that, although cases may be on the rise, the rates of mortality allegedly caused by the supposed new coronavirus are actually decreasing in the US, just as they are in the rest of the world.
    How could that be? Because this non-novel, run-of-the-mill virus is on its way out. In reality, the states that were hit first at the start of the year—predominantly northern states like Washington , Ohio , and New York —were also the first to experience a consistent downward trend in mortality rates, commencing around mid-to-late April. (See the Worldometers website, which, despite its bloated fatality numbers, is nevertheless a good source for interpreting trends in mortality rates.) States in warmer climates, such as California , Arizona , Texas , and Florida , are only now, in mid-to-late-summer months, reaching their peak daily death rates. Soon they, too, will begin to show a decline in mortality rates.
    Why is there a difference in the timing of these peaks and descents among the states? It just means that for any number of reasons—for instance, a variation between individuals in their susceptibility to infection and their propensity to infect others—different regions of the country have reached the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT) at different times. The HIT is the percentage of the population that needs to be immune in order to prevent the disease from spreading. This value varies among not only regions but nations as well. It is usually around the 10 percent to 20 percent mark for the seasonal flu—meaning that once the HIT value passes 20 percent, the rate of new infections starts to decline until the virus is extinguished.
    In January 2020, health officials and scientists originally thought that the HIT value for COVID-19 was going to be over 60 percent. But after five months a very different picture emerged. From a team of international research scientists who released a paper on herd immunity in late July, we learn that the global HIT this year was in the aforementioned 10–20 percent range. And thanks to the intrepid research done by J.B. Handley, a frequent contributing writer to the Children’s Health Defense website , we now know that the HIT value for COVID-19 in the US this year has also been in the 10-20 percent range, just like any seasonal flu. Hence, we can conclude from this data that over 70 percent of the population has already developed a natural immunity to the virus from previous exposure to corona-type viruses.
    All of this proves that our complex and beautifully designed immunity system, which produces killer T-cells and antibodies to fight off all viruses for the purpose of building herd immunity, is doing exactly what it has been doing for the past 200,000 years. Not incidentally, most of those years were before vaccines were dreamed up, developed, and brought to market. Had this not been the case, the human species would have vanished off the face of the earth long ago.
    Despite the empty rhetoric of our politicians, we now know that the draconian, counterproductive lockdown measures (read: the shutdown of the global economy) imposed by local, state, provincial, and national governments (read: and their technocrat handlers) have nothing to do with defeating the spread of the virus. If anything, the mandatory lockdowns only postpone the day when herd immunity is inevitably reached. Even New Zealand, which completely closed itself off from the rest of the world at the start of the fake pandemic, was simply delaying its day of reckoning.
    If one wanted to delay a society from reaching herd immunity from the flu for as long as possible, one would do the following to everyone (including healthy people, who have no comorbidities): impose strict, lengthy quarantine measures after travel, isolate even non-travelers in their homes for most hours of the day, enforce physical distancing rules, require the use of face masks, close everything from beaches and amusement parks and stadiums to restaurants and hair salons and, God forbid, churches and temples and mosques! Oh, and shut down schools. As we have seen, this is exactly what the political and medical “rulers”—including fake philanthropists—of most countries did, to their barely suppressed delight and to everyone else’s dismay.
    A country that stands in stark contrast to this stalling tactic is Sweden. It has refused to participate in the total lockdown strategy. Instead, from the first, it allowed herd immunity to build up naturally. Yet Sweden’s HIT value is at 14 percent—in the same range as the nations that did impose lockdowns. By keeping its economy open and isolating only its vulnerable citizens (the elderly and people with comorbidities), Sweden was the only major economy in the world that grew in the first quarter of the year . Meanwhile, according to the data collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis , the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the US decreased 34.3 percent, or $2.15 trillion, in the second quarter, to a level of $19.41 trillion. This is the most devastating collapse in GDP ever recorded.
    The GDP drop doesn’t take into account the incalculable human losses—the slide into poverty, the despair, the mental breakdowns, the suicides—that the cruelly counterproductive lockdown has created. Commenting on these detrimental effects, Stanford University’s 2013 Chemistry Nobel Laureate Dr. Michael Levitt said in an interview : “There is no doubt in my mind that when we come to look back on this, the damage done by the lockdown will exceed any saving of lives by a huge factor.”
    Fiction #5: The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) for COVID-19 is far greater than the seasonal influenza.
    Fact #5 : The IFR is the ratio of deaths attributed to a disease divided by the number of actual infections. Unique to COVID-19, the IFR includes both confirmed and undiagnosed cases, as perversely directed by the CDC. Family physician Dr. Scott Jensen , who is also a Minnesota state senator, explains in an interview on Fox News that this practice of combining both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases is simply a tool to “game the numbers” so that the government can conveniently inflate the death toll and scare the public into believing COVID-19 is more deadly than it actually is.
    (Aside: Jensen’s refreshing candor stands in stark contrast to the apparent go-along-to-get-along mentality of the many doctors who remained silent when he sounded the alarm over the health authorities’ suspicious-sounding instructions. Not that Jensen is without equally courageous colleagues. In fact, he belongs to a new group of more than 600 physicians who call themselves America’s Frontline Doctors and who are calling out US authorities for suppressing information about and access to the coronavirus-slaying drug Hydroxychloroquine. Their July 27 th press conference video from the steps of the US Supreme Court went viral before being banned across all social media platforms.)
    In the developed world, the Infection Fatality Rate for a seasonal influenza is 0.1–0.2 percent. Bizarrely, the WHO’s initial estimate in March 2020 pegged the IFR for COVID-19 at 3.4 percent. We have since learned, from the meticulous serological studies done by Stanford University epidemiologist and professor of medicine Dr. John Ioannidis (and from many other equally scrupulous scientists around the world), that the global average for COVID-19 is actually about 0.2 percent —in line with the seasonal flu and vastly lower than the WHO’s 3.4 percent gross overestimate. In light of this scientific fact, we must ask the obvious question: Why do we need a global vaccine regimen imposed on everyone for a virus that has the same low fatality rate as the seasonal flu?
    Though Dr. Ioannidis’ study was published in late May, he had determined as early as April—after analyzing twelve separate IFR studies conducted by researchers around the world—that the IFR for COVID-19 was in the range 0.07 to 0.2 percent. In addition, one month after his conclusion was published, the US CDC admitted that the overall IFR rate is just 0.26 percent . Yet even this number is slightly high. For when the CDC calculates the mortality rate, it includes both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19. The CDCannouncement should have caused every government to pause and rethink their restrictive, hurtful strategies. But nothing changed. Instead, this desperately needed perspective from the world’s leading scientists never even made headlines. Why? Apparently it fit neither the official narrative of COVID-19’s dangers nor the promises being made by “public health expert” Bill Gates of the wonders of the coming anti-COVID-19 vaccine.
    Cui Bono?
    From the inception of this manufactured crisis, way back in January 2020—which now feels like a lifetime ago!—the stated purpose for the lockdown measures was to “flatten the curve” so that hospitals everywhere would not be overwhelmed by the inevitable wave of incoming COVID-19 patients. Governments around the world did exactly that: they flattened the curve to the point of destroying the lives of millions of people and ruining their own national economies.
    Strange, isn’t it, that apparently very few hospitals, including in big cities, have been overrun by patients. Take for example, the Berlin hospital that a German journalist walked through at the height of the pandemic, only to discover, to his surprise, that no one was there. Or check out what citizen journalists were video recording in supposedly maxed-out-with-patients hospitals around the US. Incidentally, this Dana Ashlie video, which can be seen on BitChute, was banned from YouTube for purportedly violating Terms of Service. (Translation: Facts that contradict the pandemic propagandists’ fakery mustn’t be seen or heard by the general public, lest their fear of a virulent, fatal disease be deflated like a popped balloon.)
    Strange, too, that many so-called COVID-19 cases were anything but. Consider, for example, the situation in Italy , where “only 12 per cent of the death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus, while 88 per cent of patients who have died have at least one pre-morbidity—many had two or three.”
    Strange, too, that in New York State, all the cases deemed to be COVID-19 were elderly patients who were removed from hospitals and dumped in nursing homes , where neglect and overcrowding and even the emotional toll produced by loneliness and fear resulted in many sickeningly sudden and sad deaths.
    And isn’t it especially strange that one of the most obvious outcomes of flattening the curve was the loss of everyone’s constitutional, civil, medical, parental, and religious rights? It was as if there had been a plan all along to dispense not only with lives, but also with rights—including the right to dissent!
    Now here we are, months later, still being bombarded by scary scenarios. Every major news outlet pounds us with fear-mongering predictions of second and third waves. The engineered-to-skyrocket cases of COVID-19 in the US are dominating the headlines. Some state governors and state and county health authorities and privately owned establishments are imposing ever-more-onerous rules regarding face masks and physical distancing—rules they realize would never pass the legal smell test in normal times, much less in a court of law. Meanwhile, the same dictators are doubling down on their innocent-sounding “let’s all get tested” message.
    As the above five facts have shown, all of these public health measures are based on unsubstantiated science. Moreover, we have not even begun to feel the long-lasting economic effects of the “pandemic.” In the coming months and years, our national economies will become much more precarious. Is it possible that we already cash-strapped citizens will be ordered to pay back the billions of dollars that have been divvied out to us by our Big Brother governments?
    In some places, lockdowns may be gradually easing. But the relief measures being implemented have not helped the countless mid-sized and small business owners who have, one by one, decided to board their doors and close up shop forever. They are suffering twice-over: they must watch their own families be penalized and at the same time feel guilty for having to bid farewell to their employees, who by the millions are looking for non-existent jobs and standing in long unemployment lines. As layoffs keep mounting, nations are facing a massive fiscal crisis at the very time when their badly needed tax revenues are disappearing. In the near future, national governments will be forced to hand over entire sectors of the economy to their creditors, such as Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. In the end, private financial oligarchies will literally own the US and other nations, further eviscerating the concept of national sovereignty.
    So, why are we being forced to travel down this rocky road? One possible explanation could be that many governments may consider it political suicide to admit that their approach has been wrong. Thus, instead of immediately correcting their course of action, they are incrementally shifting gears. But could there be something far more sinister at play here? Could this entire “pandemic” be a gigantic smokescreen designed to conceal the diabolical actions of the globalist technocrats, whose agenda is to literally create, possess, and control a single worldwide economy and a single worldwide government?
    If we follow the money trail, we can determine who some of the possible beneficiaries of such a fiendish agenda could be.
    To begin, let’s look at the financial sector. Since the US mortgage and market crash of 2008, none of the mechanisms that allowed the crash to occur have been removed. True, for the past twelve years, the stock market has appeared to recover. In reality, though, the market is the opposite of healthy. It has been surviving mainly on stock buybacks by companies that have been using some of their profits to buy their own stocks in order to prop up prices. This scheme has provided the illusion that the economy is thriving. But the stock market’s action is not an absolute indicator of the real economy’s production and consumption.
    Indeed, by the summer of 2019 it had become evident that not even the stock buyback strategy was going to keep the lumbering economy alive. Thus, as a short-term solution, the New York Federal Reserve last September started injecting billions of dollars into the stock market in the form of short-term loans (repos). While the intent was to keep the stock market chugging along, the effect was more like kicking an empty tin can down the road for as long as possible until finally the road ends. Eventually, a long-term solution would have to be found to reset the entire world economy. Enter the “shadow bank” BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $7 trillion dollars in assets under direct management and another $20 trillion managed through its Aladdin risk-monitoring software.
    In a statement released in August 2019 on Bloomberg News, BlackRock observed that “the current policy space for global central banks is limited and will not be enough to respond to a significant, let alone a dramatic, downturn.” To solve this problem, BlackRock hired former central bankers from the US, Canada, and Switzerland. Their orders were to devise a plan that would enable BlackRock to expand its role in the global fiscal and monetary policy arena by blurring the lines between government fiscal policy and central bank monetary policy. The plan was due by the end of August.
    Are we surprised that the COVID-19 crisis precipitated the very dramatic downturn to which BlackRock alluded mere months earlier? Hardly. Both the pandemic and the ensuing stock market crash have presented the perfect opportunity for BlackRock and other central banks to take full control of global monetary policy. The economic reset that the globalists have been talking about since 2014, both at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) —and, more recently, in June 2020, at the World Economic Forum (WEF)—is now well underway.
    After the market crashed in late February, the Federal Reserve came out with a $10 trillion USD bailout package, of which $454 billion is to be administered by BlackRock under the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). In other words, this money from taxpayers to the government will be used to directly buy stocks, bonds, junk bonds, mortgages, and junk mortgages from Wall Street investment firms. These purchases are designed to inflate the value of stock market assets. In the US, some 85 percent of these assets are held by the richest 10 percent of Americans. BlackRock has also been hired by the Bank of Canada and Sweden’s central bank, Riksbank, to implement their respective stimulus plans.
    Keep in mind that none of this money will be fueling real economic activity. None of it will be used to help millions of people revive their small businesses and improve their living standards. It is, pure and simple, a bailout package for the players in the global stock market. It provides the illusion that the Main Street economy is on the mend. Governments claim the stimulus money will be used to build the means of production and help small business. Truthfully, the exact inverse is occurring: the largest redistribution of wealth in human history is taking place, which will only increase the gap in income inequality throughout the world.
    Although there is no “smoking gun” to definitively prove that the COVID-19 pandemic was the preplanned pretext for launching the much-vaunted “Great Reset,” the timing is nonetheless too coincidental to ignore.
    Now, let’s look at another group that could massively gain from this supposed pandemic: the pharmaceutical industry. If this industry, with Bill Gates at its helm, successfully launches its campaign to vaccinate every person on the planet against SARS-Cov-2, the drug-and-vaccine-makers could potentially rake in tens of billions of dollars.
    Big Pharma holds tremendous sway in the political realm—both internationally and domestically. In mid-April, President Donald Trump announced that the US would be ending its financial support for the World Health Organization, which he accused of “severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.” In previous years, the top funder for WHO had been the US government, followed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The third-biggest donor to WHO was Gates-founded-and-funded GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance. Thus, if Trump’s move to defund that international body goes through, it will elevate both the Gates Foundation and Gates’s GAVI to the top of the global health pyramid. This would further tighten Bill and his wife Melinda’s already firm grip on WHO and thus strengthen their ability to formulate global “health” policy.
    As if further signaling its disdain for WHO, in early June the Trump administration boosted its support for GAVI with a donation of a $1.16 billion USD (again, taxpayer dollars) via the first-ever virtual Global Vaccine Summit . That huge sum stands in stark contrast to the US government’s modest contributions to WHO of $401 million in 2017 and $281.6 million in 2018.
    During the same summit, GAVI received from many other nations large contributions that totaled $8.8 billion USD. (The Rockefeller Foundation, which has numerous ties to the vaccine agenda, kicked in $5 million of that sum.) These injections of liquidity—ominously reminiscent of the injections of liquid that are known as vaccines—will provide GAVI with all of the funding it needs for the purpose of pushing the global vaccine agenda on governments and for maintaining its role in “public-private partnerships” with governmental bodies and private companies.
    For those of us who may not be conversant with the lobbying process, here’s how it works across national borders. Because neither Bill Gates nor his foundation can directly lobby a foreign government, being a founding partner of GAVI enables Gates to seek out and hire representatives in targeted nations who will lobby on behalf of his interests.
    In Canada, for instance, GAVI has hired Crestview Strategy , an Ottawa-based lobbying firm that specialises in shaping government policy by speaking directly to the Canadian government’s key decision-makers and opinion leaders. The government relations page on Crestview’s website defines its mission thusly:
    “Crestview Strategy effectively represents the interests of corporations, not-for-profits and industry associations to achieve results with governments around the world.”
    While representing “the interests of corporations, not-for-profits and industry associations” in pushing the vaccine message on behalf of GAVI, has Crestview crossed an ethical threshold? In other words, has there been any collusion between Gates proxy Crestview and the Canadian government? Or is it pure coincidence that Prime Minister Trudeau shares Bill Gates’s view that only a mass vaccination program will allow populations to return to lives of normalcy?
    It depends who you ask and what they know. Journalists at Canuck Law , an independent media outlet that investigates political corruption in Canada, answer “yes” to collusion and “no” to pure coincidence. Canuck Law researchers dug up the fact that Crestview Strategy employs two former Liberal Party associates, Jason Clark and Zakery Blais, to lobby the Canadian government on behalf of GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance. These two Liberal Party operatives-turned-lobbyists met with the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) staff—the chief of staff, the director of policy and planning, a policy advisor, and a special assistant—as well as with members of Parliament on at least nineteen occasions between March 2018 and January 2020 to push the GAVI vaccine message. Records show that a third Crestview employee, Jennifer Babcock, who has since left the firm, lobbied the government for GAVI just one time.
    Canuck Law explains: “These are just 20 reports that are on file with the Office of the Lobbying Commissioner. It’s fair to assume that there have been many, many more talks that aren’t documented.” It therefore comes as no surprise that Ottawa has thus far shelled out some $800 million for Gates’s global vaccine agenda and that PM Justin Trudeau constantly refers to society as living in “the new normal until a vaccine is found.”
    In the US government, the level of corruption among vaccine promoters is more entrenched and insidious. Big Pharma far outpaces all other industries in spending on lobbying in Washington, D.C. In 2019, for instance, it spent twice as much on lobbying as the oil and gas industry and almost three times more than the defense industry. There are more pharmaceutical industry lobbyists than the 435 representatives in the House and the 100 US senators combined. Drug-and-vaccine-makers and their industry associations and paid corporate lobbyists aim to influence any and all related legislation and regulations. They also seek preferential treatment through campaign contributions. No wonder the State of Tennessee has already mandated that students are required to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. No wonder, too, that the Trump administration on July 31 st handed over $2.1 billion in taxpayer money to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Sanofi to expedite further COVID-19 vaccine development.
    The Total Surveillance Grid is Forming
    Now that we have seen who some of the financial winners are in this orchestrated pandemic, let’s examine how the know-it-all technocrats and parasitic, predator globalists plan to monitor and track our every move.
    Their total surveillance grid, hiding in plain sight behind the COVID-19 scamdemic, is being tested in West Africa before it is rolled out in the rest of the world. Here, the Gates-tied GAVI and Mastercard and the AI-powered “identity authentication” company Trust Stamp have joined forces in the effort to link a biometric digital identity system, vaccination records, and a “ cashless ” payment system all into a single platform.
    Under this alliance, Mastercard’s Wellness Pass program will be integrated into Trust Stamp’s biometric identity platform. The Wellness Pass will thus be capable of providing biometric identity information on any person, even in areas of the world lacking internet access or cellular connectivity. Moreover, the Wellness Pass will also be linked to an individual’s cashless payment system. This could potentially provide authorities with the ability to block a person’s account if he does not abide by certain mandates regarding health measures. Such massive surveillance and control are eerily similar to China’s “social credit” system.
    This entirely new Trust Stamp platform will be coupled with the COVID-19 vaccination program, if and when a vaccine becomes available, through a COVI-PASS , the brand name for a digital health passport, which authorities will automatically download (push) to your device. The COVI-PASS, which was developed by British cybersecurity company VST Enterprises in partnership with several other tech firms, is slated to be rolled out in fifteen countries across the world, including Canada, Italy, Portugal, France, Spain, Panama, South Africa, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, and the Netherlands. The pass will contain a person’s COVID-19 test results and vaccination history plus any relevant health information. A truly Orwellian prospect!
    Gates’s funding is not strictly limited to the field of global health. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in cooperation with GAVI, is also deeply tied to ID2020—a global digital ID system that will combine both birth registration records and vaccination records to create a digital identity for every person on planet Earth.
    At first glance, ID2020 may seem like it’s the same concept as the COVI-PASS, but it is actually far more. The COVI-PASS, as mentioned above, relates more to one’s health record, whereas ID2020 is a complete identification record of your entire life. It is your driver’s license, passport, work identification pass, building access card, debt and credit cards, transit passes, police record, health records, and more—all wrapped up in one identification system. It is being sold to us by the statists as a new and improved means of “protecting our civil liberties and personal data,” when in reality the exact inverse is true: as with any electronic device, it can and will be used by the-powers-that-shouldn’t-be to monitor a person’s every move, and if necessary, restrict a person’s movements.
    Although ID2020 was originally formed in 2019, when GAVI joined forces with the Rockefeller Foundation, Microsoft, Accenture, and IDEO.org, it was put into motion by the globalists at the onset of the supposed pandemic. And it is now being tested in Bangladesh. Once again, as we have already seen in the above-mentioned economic reset, the COVID-19 crisis presents the perfect opportunity to launch the ID2020 system.
    The Path Forward
    We must now ask ourselves: Is it merely coincidence that these measures—the economic reset, the implementation of ID2020, the creation of Trust Stamp, and Mastercard’s Wellness program—are all being put into motion, simultaneously, on the heels of the fabricated pandemic? We may never find out if their joint appearance is a coordinated effort by just a few top technocrats or by all the participants in these schemes—the usually compartmentalization of information and tasks keeps the lower-level actors from knowing the real purpose and the high-up players in any scheme of this sort.
    What is certain, though, is that all of the medical martial law edicts that have been issued in united fashion have been based on unsubstantiated science. Equally clear is that the drive for a global COVID-19 vaccine regimen and the global surveillance grid are moving ahead in concert to transform the world as we know it— if we allow it to happen. As Professor Michel Chossudovsky and others have often said, we need mass movements, such as the #ExposeBillGates movement, to counter and dismantle the technocrats’ diabolical designs on us.
    When and if our governments ever signal—presumably post-mass vaccination— that it is time to return to normal, beware. We must never go back to the old normal. For it is this old normal—based on a corrupt and broken paradigm—that landed us in pandemic prison in the first place. We must move forward with the new knowledge we have acquired in recent months, and we must build a better paradigm—one based on truth and compassion for all of humanity.
    Madame Curie was right. Nothing is to be feared, it is only to be understood. We must fearlessly speak out and share this information.

    Daily graphic of Wall Street indexes. Tribune News Service 2020 TNS Save
    NEW YORK — The S&P 500 ticked higher to close at another all-time high Friday, powered by strength for technology stocks and a couple reports on the U.S. economy that were better than expected.
    The benchmark index rose 11.65 points, or 0.3%, to 3,397.16, even though the majority of stocks in the index weakened. It followed up on losses across Europe after more discouraging reports there indicated a slowdown in its economies.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 190.60, or 0.7%, to 27,930.33, and the Nasdaq composite added 46.85, or 0.4%, to 11,311.80.
    The S&P 500 surpassed its prior closing high of 3,389.78, which was set on Tuesday after the index erased the last of its historic losses from the coronavirus pandemic. Despite its record-setting week, the market's momentum has slowed recently after roaring back from its nearly 34% plunge from late February into March.
    The S&P 500 rose 0.7% for the week. It was the seventh gain for the index in the last eight weeks, but the last two have been the most modest during that stretch.
    Investors are still waiting for more clarity on several fronts, which could drive the next big move up or down.
    The economy has shown some signs of stalling recently, with Friday's reports from Europe the latest reminder that a steady rise in coronavirus cases may be undermining growth. They follow a U.S. report from Thursday that showed that the number of workers applying for unemployment benefits picked up last week.
    But the picture remains mixed. A separate report from IHS Markit on Friday said preliminary data suggests output from the U.S. private sector is at an 18-month high. Sales of previously occupied homes were also stronger in July than economists expected, as activity exploded in every region of the country.
    Those reports helped the U.S. stock market recover from declines earlier in the morning.
    "The housing market is strong," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. "This week has been about housing. Each one of these reports has been strong."
    Stocks of homebuilders climbed following the data, including a 3.2% rise for D.R. Horton. But it was additional gains for tech stocks that did the most work in the S&P 500's rally.
    Most stocks on Wall Street fell, and the smaller companies in the Russell 2000 small-cap index lost 11.83, or 0.8%, to 1,552.48. Even within the S&P 500 index of big companies, 56% of stocks were lower, with energy producers and financial stocks dropping. But a 1.2% rise for tech stocks in the S&P 500 helped offset that.
    Tech has remained remarkably resilient through the pandemic and continued to churn out big profits as work-from-home and other tech-friendly trends accelerate. Apple, which this week became the first U.S. company to have a market value of more than $2 trillion, rose 5.2%. More from this section",

    yukisohmasmokesweed :
    awww ur so sweet tysm!!! i feel like these answers will probably end up being a little unconventional but i will try, i normally dont think about stuff like this but this is a cute prompt!
    tohru - whatever body wash is on sale that week but prefers fruity. im picking a side and saying strawberry is her go-to
    yuki - old spice because he thinks it’s classy and manly. its not, he smells like a teenage boy
    kyo - you know those straight boys in ur school who always reek of axe? yeah. also he sweats a lot and is self conscious about it so he always has some in his bag, which means all of his stuff also smells like axe
    haru - musk because haru actually is classy and cares about his General Image
    momiji - has a debilitating lush addiction and buys their sweetest smelling products. has vanilla, lemon, and lavender scented products in rotation
    rin - rin….does not seem like she has the best personal hygiene but when she does bother to shower she uses like coconut or coffee scented stuff, def goes for a more mellow scent
    shigure - no matter what shigure does he always smells like cigarettes. its his own fault because he smokes inside in his day clothes. he also has never shopped for himself so he uses whatever plain jane soap tohru brings him, so like irish spring or something. steals hatori’s cologne when he has to socialize with normal people
    ayame - has an extensive cologne collection and all in like rly eclectic scents, like creed. sometimes he smells like ~the lush countryside of ireland~ or ~lemon, bargamot, verbena, and orangewood~ or ~blackcurrant, jasmine blossoms, and oak moss~ just depends on his mood!
    hatori - hatori works very hard to NOT reek of cigarettes. he seems like a classy dude, he uses sandalwood soap and he also wears like. ralph lauren cologne
    kureno - michael kors extreme blue yes i went into my 21 yr old brothers room to find this because i needed an extremely boring, run of the mill scent and my golf bro stock market loving asshole of a brother delivered
    akito - ginger and mandarin soap, classy + gender neutral
    ritsu - chamomile/earl grey/more subtle tea-scented body spray
    kagura - she has a rotation of floral scented victoria’s secret body sprays, ie jasmine & passionfruit, orchid & mimosa, cherry blossom & peach etc
    hiro - has recently started using axe but like W Y too much you can smell him a mile away
    kisa - no-tear baby shampoo
    kakeru - would go for a more woody, musky cologne but puts too much on and smells like an abercrombie & fitch
    machi - dove bar soap and whatever deodorant is directly in front of her at the store. doesn’t think about it that much",

    title: "I was unemployed for two months. It affirmed my desire to FIRE.",
    text: "Hello everyone, I wanted to share some of my experiences after a brief period of unemployment.
    First some background, starting with where my mind was at. I had been working for an engineering company for 4 years and methodically contributing to my accounts in pursuit of FIRE, but I had certain concerns about it on my mind. Sometimes it would be demoralizing to run the numbers and see that FIRE was years off. Sometimes it even felt like it consumed my identity. Like it had become my ambition to watch numbers become bigger on a computer screen, instead of having an enriching career. I say this even as someone who made a conscious effort to try not to worry about it too much and enjoy my precious youth. I have continued to develop strategies to keep my attention on the present and enjoying my youth now. I also had concerns if I would be able to be happy in a life without work when I did reach the ability to FIRE.
    In June I was dismissed from my job. What followed has, in my view, given me the confidence and assuredness to continue on this path. At the time, I was 28 and I had 80k in retirement accounts, 22k cash, and 34k in the stock market, rented a home, and had absolutely zero debt.
    There are two distinct components I’d like to talk about. The first part of my satisfaction in pursuing FIRE was that I was enormously grateful I had made the choice to save money over the years. From day one, the pressure to resurrect my income was low because I had such a cushion to fall on. Many times over the years I had put money away instead of spending it on toys or even buying myself lunch thinking, “There may come a day when I wish I had held onto this money for a rainy day.” Decisions like that compounded. It’s clear that one of the benefits of FIRE is the freedom that comes even while still pursuing it. However I cannot deny that the additional $600 per week benefit due to the Covid situation was also well-timed and hugely alleviating. I also live with my girlfriend who pays 33% of the home expenses and, given that she is still working from home, could take on more if the situation deteriorated. Not to mention the stock market exploded. I admit, I was fortunate in many of my circumstances.
    The second component is how I spent the two months: My days were often spent waking up at 7 am (much improved from 5 am when I was working), prepping breakfast for my girlfriend, listening to political talk radio until 9 am, walking and training my German Shepherd until 10 am, reading books and drinking coffee until noon, using the hot afternoons to go to the gym, clean the house, comfort my girlfriend more as she worked, and then read more. I went for runs at sundown. I researched day-hikes that we could do on the weekend. Sprinkled in there were job applications which ultimately led to me getting a new job in the same area. Therefore, no move will be required. I recognize that here too, I’m very fortunate.
    While unemployed, I parted with some money to get some festering problems fixed. I spent $800 to fix my car’s cooling system and now it runs beautifully. Parting with this much money may be counter to the frugality that unemployment should inspire. But the way I saw it, now I had the time to negotiate with mechanics around town, and get the car fixed up and properly running before the next phase of my life. Not to mention that FIRE again help yield the extra cash that could be expended on these necessities. No longer have to worry about a nuclear meltdown on my car.
    The point is that I felt very satisfied with this lifestyle, not trapped in a hell of purposelessness. I feel regenerated and rested. Mentally stimulated from all the reading I did. Productive for up-keeping on the house, training my dog, and getting my car fixed.
    Maybe I’m wrong in this assessment of how things happened. But its made me feel much more assured in my pursuit of this financial security and prospect of being able to stop working. I’ll continue to relish my youth while I have it, but I feel more comfortable than before that the pursuit of FIRE gives me the safety net to absorb hardship along the way, and will give me the lifestyle that I want on the distant horizon.
    As a final note, the week after I was released from my job I found a kitten in the road that needed $300 in vet care. FIRE also allows you absorb the expenses of those who need your help.",

    When female investors begin investing, they may not only do their own research but also speak with friends and family members who would have been investing in equities since long. However, as they continue their journey they might come across several terminologies that are used by individuals and publications which track the markets.
    Unfortunately, because of gender stereotypes, it is believed that women can't handle money matters. However, research has shown that women turn out to be successful investors.
    Therefore, women must neither get overawed by these terms nor remain ignorant. One can create a check-list of stock market-related terms and keep adding new ones every time one comes across it. To get started, here is a handy glossary to help you out with 23 terms related to the stock markets:
    ⦁ Share market : Anywhere you can buy or sell shares. All stock exchanges across India are part of the Indian share market. Any shares that you buy or sell outside the exchanges are also part of this share market.
    ⦁ Stock exchange: This is a specific facility where stocks are listed for sale/purchase. All stock exchanges in India are now digital, and you can access them online through a brokerage firm.
    ⦁ Over-the-counter: If you trade a security that is not listed in a stock exchange, you are making an over-the-counter trade.
    ⦁ Stock: Stock is a general term used to refer to a certificate indicating ownership in a company.
    ⦁ Share: A share is a stock certificate of a particular company. So, if an investor says that she owns 10 stocks – she is most likely referring to shares from 100 different companies. On the other hand, if she says she is buying 100 shares, she is referring to shares of a single company.
    ⦁ Bull market: When stock prices in a market are generally rising, it is called a bull market.
    ⦁ Bear market: The exact opposite of a bull market is a bear market – when the stock prices in the market are generally falling it is called a bear market.
    ⦁ Order: It is a show of intent to buy or sell shares in a given price range. For example, you may place an order to buy up to 100 shares of Company A, at a maximum price of Rs. 80 per share.
    ⦁ Bid: Your bid is the amount that you are willing to pay for a share.
    ⦁ Ask: Ask is the price at which you are willing to sell a share.
    ⦁ Bid-ask spread : This is the difference between the amount people are willing to spend to buy a share and the amount at which the shareholders are willing to sell a share. A trade can only happen when this spread is resolved. That is, if the lowest price at which a share for Company A is being sold is Rs. 40, and the highest price someone is willing to pay for such a share is Rs. 38 – no trade can happen. The trade can only happen when the bid and ask prices match.
    ⦁ Market order: An order to sell/buy shares at the market price is called a market order. It is advisable to avoid placing market order as the trade price can be very volatile.
    ⦁ Limit order : An order to sell shares above a set price or buy shares below a set price is called a limit order. You should always use limit orders to trade shares.
    ⦁ Day order: An order that is good only till the end of the trading day is called a "day order". If the order does not get executed by the time the market closes, it would be cancelled.
    ⦁ Good-till-cancelled order: An order that will stay open until it is either executed or manually cancelled. Such orders may stand for weeks if no shares are available to trade in the price range specified. For example, if you place a GTC order to buy a share of Company A for Rs. 50 or less and the share is currently trading at Rs. 70 If it takes the share to hit Rs. 50 price point a week later, the order will be executed then. If it were a day order, it would have been cancelled at the end of the trading day itself.
    ⦁ Liquidity: Liquidity refers to how easily a stock can be sold off. A share that can be sold off quickly i.e. has high trade volumes is said to be highly liquid.
    ⦁ Trading volume: The number of shares being traded on a given day is called trading volumes. ⦁ IPO/Initial Public Offering: The first time a company offers its share for trading on a stock exchange. Typically, you buy shares from the previous owner of the share and not the company directly. In case of an IPO, you get to buy the shares directly from the company.
    ⦁ Market capitalisation: Market capitalisation is simply the value of the company as per the stock market. That is, the current value of all its shares put together.
    ⦁ Mutual Funds: Mutual funds is a way of investing across a large number of stocks by pooling your funds with other investors. This allows you to diversify your investment even if you have limited funds. Further, a fund manager takes care of selecting the right stocks to invest in.
    ⦁ Exchange-Traded Funds: These are mutual funds that you can trade like shares on the stock exchange. They usually track an index.
    ⦁ Index: A benchmark that is used by investors and portfolio managers to measure market performance. Nifty and Sensex are such benchmarks. If your portfolio returned 10%, that may sound really good. But if the Sensex returned 12% during the same period – your portfolio did not perform very well.
    ⦁ Portfolio: Portfolio is simply the collection of all the investments an investor has made.
    ⦁ Intra-day trading: Intraday trading is about buying and selling stocks on the same day so that all positions are closed before trading hours are over on that day.
    ⦁ Dividends: Dividend is a part of the profit distributed by a corporation among its shareholders. When a company earns profit during a financial year, a part of that profit is usually distributed as dividends among its share holders.
    This list is not exhaustive. There are many more terms that you will come across as you invest in the share market. Reach out to us for any help that you need. You should also find a mentor to guide you through the process of learning how to invest.

    Skeptics are a dying breed in American equities. It’s another illustration of how risky it has become to doubt the resilience of the market’s $13 trillion surge since late March.
    Going by the short positions of hedge funds, resistance to rising prices is the lowest in 16 years. Bears pulled out as buying surged among professional investors who were forced back into stocks despite a recession, stagnating profits and the prospect of a messy presidential election.
    While perhaps logical given open-ended Federal Reserve support, rampant covering depletes at least one source of support for shares -- buying by speculators who sold them short. Virtually every constituency in the market has gotten more bullish as the S&P 500 surged 52% in five months. In the past 21 sessions, there hasn’t been a drop of 1%, the longest stretch since January. “The repurchase of those short shares has been a factor which has contributed to the rally that we’ve enjoyed,” said Lawrence Creatura, a portfolio manager at PRSPCTV Capital LLC. “It will certainly be a weaker force going forward, because mathematically it’s just simply a smaller quantity of outstanding shares that are still short.”
    The S&P 500 added 0.7% over five days, notching its fourth straight weekly gain. It exceeded the Feb. 19 record high on Tuesday to cap the fastest bear-market recovery in history. The Russell 2000 Index of smaller companies fell 1.6% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was virtually flat. The Nasdaq 100 performed better, climbing 3.5%.
    Steamrolled by a rally whose velocity is the strongest in decades, bears are giving up. At the start of August, the median S&P 500 stock had outstanding short interest equating to just 1.8% of market capitalization, the lowest level since at least 2004, data compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. show. All major sectors except energy saw bearish bets sitting in the bottom decile over the last 15 years.
    For an example of why, look at Tesla Inc., the electric carmaker whose shares have surged almost 400% this year. At near 4.5% of total shares available for trading, its short interest has fallen to a record low, down from a high of 29% a year ago, according to IHS Markit data. Other examples where bears have been thwarted are Twilio Inc., Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc. and Peloton Interactive Inc.
    “It looks like all those fund managers over the past quarter went from being bearish and expecting a stock market crash to now bullish,” Shawn Cruz, senior market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said in an interview. “Sentiment’s turned positive about equities in general but also sentiment is turning positive for a return to growth.”
    The tide is getting harder to fight with retail investors flocking to unprofitable companies such as Nikola Corp. and Moderna Inc. More money managers are forced to embrace the rally, ignoring this year’s profit contraction and banking on fiscal and monetary stimulus. At 26 times forecast earnings, the S&P 500 was trading at the highest multiple since the dot-com era.
    Obviously, rallying stocks are bad for bears -- and that frequently pushes them out of the market at times that might be ripe for skepticism. Consider the internet frenzy 20 years ago. Back then, large speculators, mostly hedge funds, were net short on S&P 500 futures in all but five weeks in 1998 and 1999. Those mostly losing bets were completely squeezed out in 2000. That’s when the crash came.
    The impact of short covering is particularly pronounced this time. A Goldman Sachs basket of the most-hated stocks has almost doubled since the market’s bottom in March, a gain that’s nearly twice as big as the S&P 500’s.
    The recovery from 2020’s bear market has emboldened bulls among trend-following traders in particular, according to Charlie McElligott, a cross-asset strategist at Nomura Securities. The firm’s model that tracks commodity trading advisers, or CTAs, showed the group went “max short” on global equity futures on March 9 and has since seen $700 billion worth of short positions covered to now be net long.
    After a five-month, uninterrupted rally, the market is starting to show signs of fatigue. While the S&P 500 rose in four of the past five days, none of the gains topped 0.5%.
    “It felt more like a lack of desire to sell rather than enthusiasm to buy except for some select rotating pockets of the market that are still attracting speculators,” said Andrew Adams, a strategist at Saut Strategy. “We will just have to see if the S&P 500 hitting new highs wakes the market up and entices some new buyers to enter.”

    text: "Consider these asset management stocks for income.</strong>" data-reactid="12"> Consider these asset management stocks for income. Financial stocks engaged in asset management are up in the stock market, as the sector has bounced back after its spring lows with more success than many retail or restaurant stocks. And while some of the most successful investment managers often have steep minimums for clients, you don't have to have a million bucks to share in the success of these firms when they are publicly traded as dividend stocks; simply owning a share of these financial stocks can help you tap into their success. Here are nine asset management stocks that offer yields of around 4% or higher. AllianceBernstein Holding (ticker: AB ) AllianceBernstein is a global asset management icon known for its investment management, research and services to both institutional and high-net-worth individuals. It also offers mutual funds and closed-end funds to retail investors. Collectively, these three major business lines add up to more than $600 billion in worldwide assets under management at present. While still below its one-year high, the stock has just about doubled in price since March's market downturn. AB's dividend payouts vary quarter to quarter based on performance, but the last 12 months of distributions add up to a very generous yield for shareholders. Current yield: 8.6% Artisan Partners Asset Management ( APAM ) Artisan Partners, founded in 1994, has about $130 billion in assets under management. Though it isn't quite as well-pedigreed as some of the larger investment firms out there, APAM's track record is incredibly strong and more than 400 top managers help keep the firm invested across various asset classes and geographies. The fund is smaller than its high point in 2015, but it continues to put up strong performance -- and more importantly for income investors, a generous dividend. This asset manager tends to offer an outsized payout at the beginning of each year, but the last 12 months show a yield that is roughly three times the average of stocks in the S&P 500. Current yield: 6.7% Apollo Global Management ( APO ) Apollo and its related enterprises are built on a private-equity empire, with big deals and turnarounds for famous names that include Twinkies manufacturer Hostess, children's entertainment chain Chuck E. Cheese and home security company ADT ( ADT ). The company manages about $300 billion in assets. While payouts dipped in response to the initial wave of the pandemic's economic disruption, the most recent distribution of 49 cents per share is just a penny below where payouts were at the end of 2019 -- a good sign business has stabilized, and that the generous dividend for shareholders will continue. Current yield: 4.1% Ares Management Corp. ( ARES ) While some investment managers pulled back on dividend payouts in early 2020, ARES increased its monthly distributions from 32 cents to 40 cents a share. That's in part because of its strength as an "alternative asset manager," offering various types of investment funds largely for institutional investors that look far beyond the typical lineup of index funds . Ares is adept at finding off-the-beaten-trail opportunities, particularly in debt markets that offer steady payments into its coffers -- which in turn support the company's generous dividends to its shareholders. Current yield: 4% Fidus Investment Corp. (FDUS) Fidus is an asset manager with a lower profile, but its dividend yield is simply amazing. FDUS has a market capitalization of about $250 million, which is relatively modest compared with the other giants on this list. Its specialized business focuses largely on senior debt and financing for transactions including change of ownership and strategic acquisitions. Fidus also offers "mezzanine" financing that allows FDUS to convert its debt into an equity stake if things go well. Thanks to this unique business model and a bias toward a few sectors it knows well, like aerospace and defense , this asset manager has carved out a nice niche for itself. Shares have more than doubled from their spring 2020 lows. With its big dividend, FDUS is worth a look for income-hungry investors interested in financial stocks. Current yield: 11.5% FS KKR Capital Corp. (FSK) FS KKR admittedly sounds like alphabet soup, but long-time market watchers may recognize the KKR abbreviation for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts -- one of the biggest and most storied investment firms on Wall Street. Though a discrete investment firm in its own right, FSK was created by a merger between FS Investment Corp. and a credit arm of KKR to form one of the largest business development companies on Wall Street at the end of 2018. Its business is largely senior secured debt -- meaning obligations that get paid first, and debt that is backed up by collateral. This combination of scale, experience and quality credit investments makes FSK tailor-made to provide consistent and generous dividends. Current yield: 15.2% Janus Henderson Group ( JHG ) Founded in 1934, Janus is a big name in asset management with a long history of success. Its business model currently focuses on institutional and high-net-worth clients. While it does offer some retail-focused offerings, its primary focus remains on mutual funds . It has not made as big of a push into exchange-traded funds as other names on Wall Street. Still, its business of investing in equity and fixed-income markets on behalf of clients is thriving, and the company's global focus allows it to find new customers everywhere from the U.S. to the U.K. to Australia. Unlike other stocks that have seen cutbacks, JHG's dividend has remained consistent at 36 cents per share each quarter throughout the last year. Shares for JHG have surged almost 100% from their 2020 lows to prove the business quickly got over the initial disruptions of the pandemic. Current yield: 6.8% Prospect Capital Corp. (PSEC) Recently highlighted as one of the most generous monthly dividend stocks , PSEC has a tremendous double-digit yield coupled with a reliable schedule of payments every 30 days or so. In fact, Prospect has been paying 6 cents in dividends to shareholders every month like clockwork since 2017. That's a strong track record in any environment, let alone during a pandemic when some of its peers rolled back dividend plans. The business of PSEC is driven by direct stakes in a diverse portfolio of investments that includes payday loan company ACE Cash Express, freight firm GlobalTranz Enterprises and dental services firm InterDent, to name a few. Current yield: 14% Waddell & Reed Financial ( WDR ) Though perhaps not a big name, the $1 billion Waddell & Reed is significantly established. And with a consistent payout of 25 cents each quarter, it's also more reliable than some of its peers when it comes to its income potential. WDR provides investment management services that include underwriting and advisory services, as well as shareholder services administration. That means it serves other financial firms that have mutual funds and other offerings in their portfolio but prefer to outsource some of the logistics and regulatory red tape around these investment vehicles. The company also distributes investment products through its wholesale channel comprising brokers, dealers and investment advisors. This diversified model is part of the reason WDR has weathered the ups and downs of 2020 better than other firms, and why it continues to pay reliable and generous dividends. Current yield: 6.4% ",

    text: "First Mover: Wacky Bitcoin-to-DeFi Crypto Markets Might Be New Home of Capitalism Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole and Muyao Shen Reblog Price Point Bitcoin was slightly lower early Friday, leaving the cryptocurrency on track for its first weekly price decline since mid-July. The largest cryptocurrency broke above $12,000 earlier in the week and failed to hold the gains, though John Willock, CEO of crypto asset manager Tritum, told CoinDesk Thursday that “maybe we’ve got $13,500 in the next phase up in the coming days.” You’re reading First Mover , CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here . Related: Market Wrap: Bitcoin Dips to $11.6K, ETH Options Predict Price Below $400 by End of Year European stocks were up and the euro was down early Friday as investors continued to bet on technology shares and a vaccine breakthrough while shrugging off fresh signs that the economic recovery is faltering. The dollar was headed for its first weekly gain since mid-June. “It does almost seem as if the entire crypto market is taking its cues from the U.S. dollar,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, told subscribers in an email. Market moves Even after growing 100-fold in the past five years, the entirety of the cryptocurrency asset class, which has a total market valuation of $372 billion , is just fraction of the $35 trillion U.S. stock market . What’s surprising is that still-fledgling digital-asset markets might be more rational and functional these days than Wall Street: The various ups and downs of token prices are sending out bona fide market signals that point to projects and opportunities where capital is warranted, and investors are responding. Mainstream investment analysts and Wall Street Journal columnists now assert matter-of-factly that the stock market is merely propped up by this year’s $3 trillion of money-printing by the Federal Reserve . Sure, bitcoin has benefited from the perception that the largest cryptocurrency might benefit from inflation, since many investors see it as a hedge against currency debasement, similar to gold. Far more fascinating are the capital flows into the semi-autonomous lending and trading systems being built atop the Ethereum and other blockchains under the rubric of “decentralized finance,” or DeFi. A real market? Soaring token prices for projects like Aave , Chainlink , Compound and Curve , not to mention good-luck-explaining-this-to-your-friends outliers like Yam and Spaghetti , have indeed attracted capital, at least for stretches. According to DeFi pulse, total value socked away into the platforms has jumped 10-fold this year to $7 billion. It might all just be speculative hype , but that might actually be preferable to global foreign exchange markets that are heavily influenced if not controlled by central bank officials. Within the digital-asset ecosystem, investors have figured out how to quickly allocate and reallocate capital whenever new opportunities arise. CoinDesk’s Daniel Cawrey reported on Thursday that juicy returns in the DeFi market are making some investors shift away, at least temporarily, from putting their money into options contracts on bitcoin. “Every derivatives trader that was looking for incremental yield and levered returns has been besotted by the magnitude of moves in DeFi,” Viashl Shah, founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, told Cawrey. “So, naturally, cost of capital dictates at least some attention that way.” Traders are even are putting their bitcoins into DeFi platforms to take advantage of the higher yields in the fast-growing arena. Since the start of the year, the number of bitcoin locked in DeFi has grown 34-fold to about 49,000. It might be a bubble, but at least it’s not a game of trying to anticipate the Fed’s next move. In fact there’s even room for investors to take bets on which projects might become dominant players in the future, without struggling so much to understand what exactly is happening, as often seems to be the case these days in so many traditional markets. “DeFi long term will revolutionize finance, but this short-term bubble is bound to pop eventually, in my opinion,” Michael Gord, co-founder of trading firm Global Digital Assets, told Cawrey. At that point, the locked-up bitcoins might flow back out of DeFi, and more money might flow back into bitcoin options. Almost like a real market. Bitcoin watch Bitcoin has pulled back more than 5% from the 13-month high above $12,400 reached on Monday. Unless buying action comes quick, downwards momentum could push prices down to $11,000, the cryptocurrency trading firm QCP noted earlier this week. Open interest in bitcoin options has risen back to near record high levels seen in July. However, that is not necessarily a bullish development, as investors have recently sold call options. That is evident from the recent recovery in the one-month put-call skew from -10% to -3%. Investors typically sell call options when they expect prices to consolidate or drop. – Omkar Godbole Token watch Dai ( DAI ): Stablecoin gets on Binance’s new DeFi staking platform.

    text: ""I'm an expert" I buy the stock market because it goes up and up and up and in December I'm going to lose everything because Tesla, Apple, Amazon ecc. are a huge bubble 🤣. But hey he study numbers and stuff and he's an "expert". The fact that he bought Link and Orchid at that price is so stupid, at least if you study numbers and stuff you had to buy link at 0.50$ and Btc at least at 4000$, eth at fucking 86$, was easy if you checked the Rsi, macd, Bollinger and "other stuff and numbers" . I bet that you will buy Btc at 80k next time 😂
    Edit: it seems that I'm not an expert in numbers and stuff because I bought Tesla at 34$ and sold at 90$ 🤔 but I got in crypto 😎. The stock market is a huge bubble right now, I made 100% profit with $spce in 1 week without leverage, and in my opinion that's not normal!",

    text: "} Mark Makela/Getty Images
    Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee for president, and he's proposed $4 trillion in new tax increases to fund a collection of federal programs to pull the US out of recession. Among the measures are a possible round of stimulus checks, state aid, $8,000 tax credits for parents with young kids, and coverage of health-insurance costs for newly jobless people. He also supports boosting unemployment benefits, though his platform doesn't specify an amount. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Joe Biden accepted the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday evening. He said he could bridge fierce political divisions if he's elected and set in motion an ambitious agenda to address a collection of historic challenges facing America.
    The US has been beset by numerous crises, Biden said. The former vice president named the coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis stemming from it, along with climate change and a racial justice movement - a combination he called "a perfect storm."
    In his speech , Biden cast President Donald Trump's record as disastrous (without naming him once). He argued he could provide an antidote to the Trump presidency by reinforcing the public health response and recalibrating the economic scales of power away from the rich and towards the middle class. He said:
    "Nearly one in six small businesses have closed this year. And this president, if he's re-elected, you know what will happen. Cases and deaths will remain far too high. More mom-and-pop businesses will close their doors, and this time for good. Working families will struggle to get by. And yet the wealthiest one percent will get tens of billions of dollars in new tax breaks."
    To that end, Biden has proposed nearly $4 trillion in new tax increases over the next decade, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Most of the new taxes would fall squarely upon the top 1% of households, and some revenue would come from a partial repeal of the 2017 GOP tax cuts.
    "There is a clear and concerted effort to tackle racial inequality on a scale we haven't seen in generations," Indivar Dutta-Gupta, co-executive director of the Georgetown Center for Poverty and Inequality, recently told Business Insider. "There is a clear willingness to raise substantial revenue from the highest-income households in a way we haven't seen for decades."

    Biden's pandemic platform Biden would increase funding for coronavirus testing and tracing to slow the rate of infections and ultimately thwart the virus. Most economists say the US economy won't be able to recover until the spread of the pathogen is under control with a vaccine.
    But with unemployment still likely to be near 10% next year, Biden has laid out a roadmap to jumpstart an economic recovery. Among those key measures:
    Another possible round of stimulus checks. Boosting unemployment benefits and strengthening existing systems. Implementing paid sick leave for workers. Creating an $8,000 annual tax credit for parents of young children. Covering the cost of health-insurance for newly unemployed people. It also includes federal aid to states. Local and state governments can draw from a pool of funding to enact rental relief programs or assist small businesses in dire financial straits due to the pandemic.
    Congress approved a one-time $1,200 stimulus check for the majority of American taxpayers earlier this year. Republicans and Democrats in Congress support a second round in negotiations for another stimulus package, but those talks are stalled. The Biden plan doesn't specify an amount.
    Other pillars of Biden's economic plan include a $700 billion initiative to shore up US manufacturing and research programs to spur innovation at home. It's part of a broader campaign plan called "Building Back Better," which also includes initiatives to tackle racial inequality.
    "When Vice President Biden says building back better, he means building an economy that is far more resilient to the kinds of shocks that come fast and furiously in today's global economy," Jared Bernstein, an outside economic adviser to Biden, said on PBS Newshour.
    Much of Biden's agenda hinges on Democrats retaking control of the Senate, which Republicans have controlled since 2014. With the filibuster in place, the size of a Democratic majority could decide whether Biden is thwarted by a GOP that's unlikely to support many of his proposals.

    text: "For more than a century, Swarovski has churned out crystals in every imaginable shape and form, from sparkling dolphin figurines to encrusted fountain pens to glittering mobile-phone cases. fashion-and-trends 14:40 IST Bloomberg | Posted by: Alfea Jamal Bloomberg A model wearing Swarovski pieces.(Swarovski)
    For more than a century, Swarovski has churned out crystals in every imaginable shape and form, from sparkling dolphin figurines to encrusted fountain pens to glittering mobile-phone cases. An affordable indulgence rarely costing more than a few hundred dollars, Swarovski trinkets have invaded every corner of the world, providing a comfortable life for the family behind the empire and for the people of Wattens, the small town in the Austrian Alps where the company is based.
    But as Swarovski celebrates its 125th anniversary, there’s little cause for jubilation. Revenue is set to take a hard hit this year, falling by a third to about 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion); management has announced 6,000 job cuts; and the family risks ceding some control should the new chief executive eventually prevail with his plans for a possible stock-market listing or a strategic partner.
    The cracks in the crystal kingdom have exposed a deep rift in the sprawling Swarovski family, consisting of more than 200 individual members, many of whom are spread between Austria and Switzerland. It’s from here, on the shores of Lake Zurich, that the company runs its main corporate functions under CEO Robert Buchbauer, himself a member of the clan. For his relatives and the residents of Wattens opposing the radical overhaul, Buchbauer has a tough message: get on board or risk being swept away by the market forces that Swarovski chose to ignore for too long.
    “It’s very painful for everybody, but we have to take the steps that we should have taken years ago,” said Buchbauer, 54. In the future, Swarovski will focus on higher quality products with unique designs rather than trying to offer everything for everybody, he said. “Swarovski crystals on a 10-euro T-shirt don’t add to our profitability and hurt our brand image.”
    Swarovski offers a cautionary lesson in the pitfalls of globalization. Rapid expansion elevated the business from its Austrian backwater onto the world’s red carpets and prime shopping streets, but then turned on the company when changing consumer trends blindsided the family long accustomed to profitable payouts. The coronavirus pandemic has only amplified the crisis, laying waste to the sprawling network of Swarovski boutiques in now deserted shopping malls and airports around the world.
    Best-known for crystal trinkets like animal figurines and ornaments, Swarovski’s 30,000 employees churn out a vast array of sparkling adornments. There are shimmering tea-light holders, stone-studded sunglasses and crystal-encrusted frames to glam up your Apple Watch.
    In the 60s and 70s, Hollywood celebrities from Marilyn Monroe to Audrey Hepburn donned Swarovski-encrusted gowns and jewelery. Big-name designers and artists, from Karl Lagerfeld to Salvador Dali to avantgarde architect Daniel Libeskind have collaborated with the Austrians. At this year’s Super Bowl concert, Jennifer Lopez paraded a Swarovski crystal manicure during her halftime performance.
    But despite its affiliation with the glittering world of high fashion and celebrities, the majority of products costs less than 100 euros. That places Swarovski into the cut-throat segment of mass-market luxury, with its thin margins and fleeting consumer loyalty.
    After years of exuberant expansion, Buchbauer says Swarovski needs to refocus and learn that less is more. That means exiting the low-margin wholesale business where cheaper competition from Egypt or China has dented profit. If Swarovski wants to survive, it needs to offer fewer but more exclusive items under its own brand, and cut back its network of 3,000 boutiques, the CEO says. Buchbauer’s vision for the new Swarovski is to sell more carefully curated products tailor-made to match consumer tastes, a turnaround he predicts will take 2-3 years to execute.
    Family-owned luxury companies have struggled to remain independent, with the likes of jewelry house Bulgari or cashmere specialist Loro Piana seeking shelter in a multi-national conglomerate like LVMH. Others, like high-end winter outfitters Moncler SpA or Canada Goose Holdings Inc. and Italian silk-and-leather label Salvatore Ferragamo SpA, have sold shares to the public, easing their access to capital.
    Buchbauer’s plans have met stiff opposition from other members of the family, who accuse him of causing irreversible damage to the components business run out of Wattens. While his critics concede that the company needs an overhaul, they say the cuts are too deep.
    “The Swarovski family is shocked,” Paul Swarovski, a member of one of the Austrian arms, said in an interview. “There are still lots of opportunities to sell billions of high-quality crystal components around the world, and Robert Buchbauer has to come up with ideas on how to gain these customers rather than shutting things down and laying off expert workers.”
    Whether Buchbauer gets his way remains unclear. His detractors say he needs approval from a shareholder meeting, which may be hard to come by given the splintered nature of the family. Buchbauer claims he has the required backing from key stakeholders.
    Back in Wattens, there’s growing concern that the good times have crumbled, with 1,800 out of 4,800 local jobs in jeopardy. In a part of Austria heavily reliant on tourism, Swarovski long promised well-paying jobs for skilled workers. Employment at the crystal emporium meant a good salary, with perks from free child care to company housing to subsidized loans. There’s also an elaborate crystal-world experience in Wattens that has drawn 15 million people since it opened in 1995.
    “It’s a massive shock for us here, and many families will feel the pain in coming months,” Wattens Mayor Thomas Oberbeirsteiner said. Because of the dwindling returns at Swarovski, the town is losing 2 million euros in revenue this year and has to reconsider planned investments in everything from public swimming pools to roads, he said.
    The conflict raging at Swarovski coincides with changing trends in consumer behavior. Today’s shoppers like to mix high-end designers with fast-fashion alternatives, often at the expense of the more affordable branded players that occupy the middle of the market, according to Zuzanna Pusz, an analyst at UBS Group AG focused on the luxury-goods industry. The rapid rise of e-commerce has diminished the relevance of physical stores and third-party retailers, long a stronghold for Swarovski. Social media has leapfrogged print advertising and many glitzy events, where Swarovski and its shimmering swan emblem were a fixture.
    Then there’s the push toward premium products and recognizable names, particularly in China. Richemont acquired Italy’s Buccellati to expand its portfolio of high-end jewelry, which also includes Van Cleef & Arpels. LVMH last year agreed to acquire Tiffany & Co. for $16 billon, picking up one of the best-known names in the jewelry market that still remains highly fragmented.
    If Swarovski wants to have a future and retain its status as a globally recognized brand, it needs to make the painful cuts now, even if it risks sparking a cross-Alpine family feud, Buchbauer said.
    “Bad news always creates lots of emotion,” the CEO said. “But in the end it’s about the long-term survival of this business.”

    Famed short-seller Andrew Left is shorting the stock of Chinese online education provider GSX Techedu. Left told Business Insider that he thinks the company is exaggerating its profitability, and will ultimately be delisted by the New York Stock Exchange "The company is crazy stupid. If you believe their financials, then you believe that they've created probably the greatest company that's ever been created since early stage Google," he said. GSX Techedu's stock is up 320% in 2020. The company has been attacked by a number of short-sellers in recent months, including Carson Block's research firm Muddy Waters, which alleged that the majority of its users are fake. Business Insider contacted GSX Techedu for comment, but the company did not respond. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Famed short-seller Andrew Left is aggressively shorting a "crazy stupid" Chinese stock that has gained more than 320% on the New York Stock exchange in 2020, as he believes it has exaggerated its earnings and will eventually be delisted.
    The activist short-seller and founder of Citron Capital, told Business Insider that he believes that the earnings of GSX Techedu are grossly inflated "anywhere between 50 to 80%."
    GSX, which is an online education provider, has surged despite a number of claims by various short-sellers casting doubt on the company's performance.

    Left said: "The company is crazy stupid. If you believe their financials, then you believe that they've created probably the greatest company that's ever been created since early stage Google. Like they're growing 350% and they're doing it profitably. It's just impossible."
    He said that despite the company's explosive stock market growth, it is "not even spoken about in China," even though it has a market capitalization of over $20 billion on the New York Stock Exchange.
    Left likened the company's performance to Tesla's stock surge, but without actually seeing any "Teslas on the road."
    The education provider went public on the New York Stock Exchange in June 2019. Shares were initially priced at $10.50. The stock is currently hovering around $90.
    The stock has come under fire by a number of reputed short sellers.
    Famed short-seller Carson Block and his firm Muddy Waters Research claimed in a May report that at least 70% of the company's users are fake.
    "We are short GSX because we conclude that it is a near-total fraud," the firm's research note said.
    Despite the claims, the stock continued to climb and touched a high of $120 on August 8.
    Business Insider contacted GSX Techedu for comment, but the company did not respond.

    "Eventually the stock price will go to zero because it'll get delisted. The auditors will tell them we have to redo your financials," Left said.
    "GSX will be the next Luckin Coffee," he predicts.
    Employees at Starbucks rival Luckin Coffee fabricated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of coffee orders last year, according to an internal investigation. That led to the stock being delisted from the Nasdaq exchange in late June.
    The Trump administration announced earlier this month it is looking to ban Chinese companies with shares traded on US stock exchanges unless they comply with American accounting requirements.
    Left said: "The question is the White House says we want to eliminate Chinese stock fraud. What have they done? Is this an investigation? Is it not an investigation?"
    Left added that he is long on Amazon shares.
    "You know, if we get a vaccine tomorrow, does everything change? You know, you don't know. But when lose or draw, I want to own Amazon," he added.",

    The Federal Reserve's unprecedented monetary easing decoupled the stock and Treasury markets, but it might play right into investors' hands, Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS , said Thursday. Treasury yields typically rise when stocks do, but the Fed's forecast of near-zero rates lasting for years led Treasurys to sink as stocks soared higher. "Investors now face a stark choice" between following precedent and exiting stocks or believing in the Fed's influence and piling into the market, Haefele said. If the equity risk premium falls to its five-year average and Treasury yields only moderately recover, the S&P 500 could jump as much as 9% by June, according to the investment chief. Visit the Business Insider homepage for more stories . Federal Reserve policy has thrown off a key trend in markets, but Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS , says investors need not worry.
    When stocks rally as rapidly as they have through the second and third quarters, Treasury yields usually jump. Investors shift more cash into stocks and risk assets and pull capital from safe havens like government debt, in turn boosting yields. Yet Treasurys sit at historic lows while economic data improves and stocks touch new records.
    The shift arrived in June, when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting that the central bank was "not even thinking about thinking about raising rates." The statement is "perhaps the moment investor expectations really changed," Haefele said in a letter. Yields disconnected from stocks and trended downward. Apart from a mild gain in August, they've steadily declined through the summer.

    The market phenomenon is here to stay for at least a few years. Fed officials said in a previous meeting they anticipate rates remaining near zero through 2022. Hawkish policies are "still a very long way off," Haefele said. In turn, market participants should prepare for, and take advantage of, the new zeitgeist.
    "Investors now face a stark choice," the investment chief said. They can either hold on to precedent and view the bond market's pricing as a harbinger for a stock market correction, or believe markets are now "more heavily influenced by Fed policy" and pile in accordingly.
    "If you, like us, believe that the latter currently reflects reality better than the former, your focus needs to shift to what the Fed is saying, and the way you think about asset prices needs to shift with it," Haefele said.

    The firm holds a base case S&P 500 target of 3,500, implying a roughly 3% gain from Friday's levels through June 2021. Such a jump would already place the benchmark index at record highs, but Haefele's more bullish scenario sees the potential for additional gains should certain criteria be met.
    First, the index's equity risk premium — how much more investors make in stocks over a risk-free investment — needs to shrink to the pre-pandemic five-year average of 3.8%, the chief investment officer said. Assuming the 10-year Treasury yield only gains to 0.85%, the S&P 500 can continue to trade at a forward price-earnings ratio of 22x. That premium would push the index to 3,700 by June, or about 9% higher, according to Haefele.
    So far, it seems as though UBS's more optimistic forecast will come to fruition. Economic data released through the end of summer show consumer spending and sentiments slowing their pace of recovery amid a resurgence of virus cases. Congress has made little progress on a second stimulus bill, and numerous economists fear a lack of fresh aid will prolong the already steep recession.

    Even the Fed expects its near-zero rates and other easing measures to stick around. Officials "agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term," according to minutes released Wednesday .
    The central bank also held back from setting any timeline for when it will relax its monetary aid efforts. For the time being, it seems as though the policymakers won't be "even thinking about thinking about raising rates" for months to come.

    text: "} Andrew Kelly/Reuters
    Peter Cecchini, the CEO and founder of AlphaOmega Advisors and former global chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, thinks the Federal Reserve has backed itself into a corner through the implementation of 0% interest rates and unlimited quantitative easing. Lofty market valuations and the emergence of a fickle retail trading boom add fuel to his bearish outlook. "It's no secret I've been bearish of the S&P 500 since about 3,000," he said. Click here to sign up for our weekly newsletter Investing Insider . Click here for more premium stories . When the market hits new all-time highs — like it did earlier this week — investor sentiment can generally be sequestered into one of two groups: (1) Stocks are going to the moon, or (2) This is going to come crashing down.
    It's safe to say that Peter Cecchini, the CEO and founder of AlphaOmega Advisors and former global chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, identifies with the latter.
    "With the S&P 500 pushing into a new high and with even longer-dated yields now already near their zero bound, it is particularly appropriate to query whether or not the Fed's dive off the bedpost to infinite QE can continue to launch equities further into outer space," he penned in a recent client note. "It's no secret I've been bearish of the S&P 500 since about 3,000."
    He continued: "For several reasons, I continue to hold this view without reservation."
    At the forefront of Cecchini's attention lies the market's valuation . Currently, the S&P 500 is churning on the loftier side of its historical average.
    And he isn't going to be caught picking up nickels in front of a steam roller.
    "First, risk versus reward is highly unfavorable at currently excessive valuations," he said. "I don't like risking four dollars to make one. For that reason, I will happily forgo the most recent 10% in large caps and 5% in small caps."
    Cecchini's take on market valuations echos that of John Hussman — the outspoken investor and former professor who's long been predicting a stock collapse.
    The way Hussman divvies it up, investors are currently wrestling with "the most extreme valuations in history, which continue to imply a two-thirds loss in the S&P 500 over the completion of this cycle."
    Adding to Cecchini's gloomy narrative is a swarm of retail traders .
    According to Joe Mecane, the head of execution services at Citadel Securities, retail traders account for about 20% of daily market activity . In Cecchini's mind, the exuberance of a retail soiree can only last so long.
    "Second, I regard uninformed WFH retail flows — emboldened by massive, temporary fiscal stimulus — as insufficient to sustain the rally," he said. "The equity markets are now like an old elevator way over capacity. It's just a matter of time before the cable snaps and its passengers end up in the basement."
    With all of that established, Cecchini thinks that the Federal Reserve has run out of levers to pull, and may be doing more harm then good.
    "It has helped some companies remain solvent for now... but there's nothing left for the Fed to do — short of becoming the Bank of Japan's twin," he concluded, referencing a central bank that makes billions of dollars of annual equity purchases in an attempt to stabilize their markets.
    "The Fed's strategy to 'lend' in an unlimited fashion is arguably as flawed as the concept of infinity itself," he said. "Most importantly, the marginal benefits of such a policy are extremely limited and may have unintended, detrimental consequences."",

    Please scroll down for the section What To Do Now. GROWTH STOCK UPTREND INTACT, REBOUND IN EUROPE LOSING STEAM August 21, 2020
    To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.
    Growth Stock Uptrend Intact
    Recently there have been many proclamations about the shift from growth to value. Let’s explore with the help of a chart.
    The Chart
    Please click here for a chart of Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ).
    Note the following: The chart shows the trendline that has been in place since April. The chart shows that the trendline is still intact. For those concerned about the shift from growth to value, the definitive answer will lie in the break of the trendline shown on the chart. The chart shows that RSI never got oversold. This means that the momentum is still intact.
    Eurozone
    The economic recovery in Europe appears to be losing steam. Eurozone August flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) came at 51.7 vs. expectation of 52.9. In July it was at 54.9.
    A rating above 50 is considered economic expansion, however the data is disappointing.
    In our analysis, as we have written before, the good economic data that we have been getting may have been due to pent up demand. What happens when the pent up demand is satisfied?
    Apple And Tesla
    Since the announcements for splits, Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) have been powering the market ahead. AAPL has reached $2T valuation mark not on any change in fundamentals but based on a split. TSLA stock price has moved to over $2000.
    A stock split adds no economic value. The last time this kind of behavior was seen was in late 1990’s. In 2000 the market crashed.
    Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks
    The momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade. Smart money is lightly selling.
    Gold
    The momo crowd is acting like a yo-yo in the early trade. Smart money is inactive.
    The momo crowd is selling silver and miners in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in silver and miners.
    For longer term, please see gold and silver ratings.
    Oil
    The momo crowd is selling oil in the early trade. Smart money is inactive.
    For longer term, please see oil ratings.
    Markets
    Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is negative but expect the momo crowd to try to push it higher. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades.
    Interest rates are ticking down and bonds are ticking up.
    The dollar is stronger.
    Trading futures is not recommended for most investors. The purpose of providing this information is to give an indication of the premarket activity that usually guides the activity when the market opens.
    Gold futures are at $1944, silver futures are at $26.64, and oil futures are $41.94.
    S&P 500 futures resistance levels are 3390, 3420 and 3460: support levels are 3320, 3278 and 3228.
    DJIA futures are down 24 points. A DICHOTOMY OF DR. COPPER BREAKING OUT AND JOBLESS CLAIMS RISING OVER ONE MILLION August 20, 2020
    To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.
    Dr. Copper
    Please click here for a chart of copper ETF CPER.
    Note the following: The chart shows that copper is breaking out. The chart shows that copper prices have been able to hang for a period of time above where they were at the February stock market high. There is a good reason why copper is called Dr. Copper. Copper has a reputation of giving good signals for the economy. Copper is widely used from building homes to electronics to power transmission. Demand for copper is a leading indicator. As a note of caution, copper is a global commodity. Its moves are based on what is going on across the globe and not just in the United States. China is an important factor in demand for copper. You already know that the stock market has risen because of the five big tech stocks and the momo crowd. It is important to look beyond the momo crowd and big tech stocks. Investors may want to consider keeping an eye on copper.
    Jobless Claims
    Initial Jobless Claims came at 1.106M vs. 990K consensus. This is a leading indicator and bearish for the economy. Of course the momo crowd would argue that more people being laid off is good for the stock market because it means more borrowing and more money printing. This ugly number may be an incentive for Democrats and Republicans to come together to borrow more for the next stimulus package. Lets hope that the next stimulus package is exclusively directed at those who truly need help. The past programs from the government and the Fed have provided some help to those who need it but for the most part have made the rich richer and not provided enough help for those who need it.
    Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks

    Gold
    The momo crowd is acting like a yo-yo in gold, silver and miners in the early trade. Smart money is inactive.

    Oil
    The momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade. Smart money is inactive.
    For longer term, please see oil ratings.
    Markets
    Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is negative but expect the momo crowd to try to push the market to new highs. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades.
    Interest rates are ticking down and bonds are ticking up.
    The dollar is stronger.

    S&P 500 futures resistance levels are 3390, 3420 and 3460: support levels are 3320, 3278 and 3228.
    DJIA futures are down 109 points. A NEW HIGH BUT SO FAR NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT August 19, 2020
    To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.
    New High
    S&P 500 made a new high but so far there is nothing to write home about. Let’s explore with the help of a chart.
    Please click here for a chart of S&P 500 ETF (SPY). This is the shortest bear market in history. The chart shows that the new high is only nominal. It is barely visible on the chart. RSI shows that the stock market has lost momentum in the process of making this nominal new high. RSI measures the internal momentum. The volume is low. This indicates lack of conviction. This is a dismal way to make a new high in spite of aggressive buying by the momo crowd. In a normal market, we would be issuing a sell signal based on this behavior. However this market is not a normal market. It is an artificial market driven by excessive money printing and borrowing. Both money printing and borrowing are likely to continue. Moreover there is hope for vaccine which can drive the market higher. So far the economic data is coming better than expected. This may be due to pent up demand. If that is the case, economic data should weaken going forward.
    Bubble Getting Bigger
    At this time, the call remains that the bubble is likely to get bigger.
    The measured target remains 3800 on S&P 500 (SPX) or 380 on ETF SPY. S&P 500 is trading around 3389 as of this writing.
    FOMC Minutes
    FOMC minutes will be released at 2:00 pm ET. They will provide more insights into the Fed’s thinking. Sometimes this is a market moving event. This time it will be a market moving event only if the minutes show some concern at the Fed about excessive money printing. However the consensus is that there is no such concern.
    Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks
    The momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade. Smart money is inactive.
    Gold
    The momo crowd is acting like a yo-yo in gold. Smart money is inactive.
    The momo crowd is acting like a yo-yo in silver and miners. Smart is inactive in both.
    For longer term, please see gold and silver ratings.
    Oil
    API showed a draw of crude inventories of 4.264M barrels vs. consensus of 2.670M barrels. This data is bearish. However the momo crowd does not seem to be concerned.
    The momo crowd is buy oil in the early trade. Smart money is inactive.
    For longer term, please see oil ratings.
    Markets
    Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is neutral and can quickly swing either way. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades.
    Interest rates are ticking down and bonds are ticking up.
    The dollar is stronger.
    Trading futures is not recommended for most investors. The purpose of providing this information is to give an indication of the premarket activity that usually guides the activity when the market opens.
    Gold futures are at $1998, silver futures are at $27.92, and oil futures are $42.72.
    S&P 500 futures resistance levels are 3395, 3420 and 3460: support levels are 3320, 3278 and 3228.
    DJIA futures are up 29 points. OVERSTIMULATION — HOUSING AND BIG BOX RETAIL BOOM, WEAKER DOLLAR August 18, 2020
    To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.
    Overstimulation
    It is no secret that we have been critical of the myopic policies of our leaders and the Fed. We are beginning to now see more signs of overstimulation. Blowout housing starts — Housing Starts came at 1.496M vs. 1.230M consensus. Blowout building permits — Building Permits came at 1.495M vs. 1.332M consensus. Big box retail boom — WMT and HD report blowout earnings significantly better than the most optimistic consensus and whisper numbers. Consumer sentiment boom — Kohl’s (KSS) says that this is the most bullish retail environment ever seen. Dollar falls to two year low. Overstimulation is occurring throughout the world — iron ore prices rise to six year high.
    This overstimulation is great in the short term but it is very negative in the long term. Unfortunately, our politicians are not able to look beyond the November election and still are not providing enough help to the people who really need it. Investors need to stay nimble.
    Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks
    The momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade. Smart money is inactive.
    Gold
    The momo crowd is extremely aggressively buying gold, silver and miners. Smart money is inactive.
    For longer term, please see gold and silver ratings.
    Oil
    The momo crowd is aggressively buying oil in the early trade. Smart money is inactive.
    For longer term, please see oil ratings.
    Markets
    Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is neutral but expect the momo crowd to push it higher and the market to open higher. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades.
    Interest rates and bonds are range bound.
    The dollar is weaker.
    Trading futures is not recommended for most investors. The purpose of providing this information is to give an indication of the premarket activity that usually guides the activity when the market opens.
    Gold futures are at $2019, silver futures are at $28.45, and oil futures are $42.47.
    S&P 500 futures resistance levels are 3390, 3420 and 3460: support levels are 3320, 3278 and 3228.
    DJIA futures are up 13 points. BUFFETT GOLD CONVERSION AFTER DERIDING GOLD – HERE IS WHY STOCK MARKET INVESTORS SHOULD CONVERT August 17, 2020
    To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.
    PBOC
    People’s Bank of China (PBOC), equivalent of our Fed, injected additional liquidity into the market. This caused the Chinese market to run up. Some of that enthusiasm is being carried to the United States.
    Wall Street Targets
    Wall Street strategists continue to raise their targets for the stock market. The most notable this morning is Goldman Sachs (GS).
    Buffett Buying Gold
    Warren Buffett has an enviable long term record in the stock market although in recent years his stock market performance has been less impressive. Lately some newer investors in the momo (momentum) crowd that is controlling this stock market have criticized Warren Buffett. Buffett’s latest move shows that he is as sharp as ever.
    Buffett has not been a fan of gold. As a matter of fact he has often derided gold. To the dismay of the gold bugs, Buffett has been the de facto leader of the anti-gold crowd. There has been a belief that investing in gold was akin to betting against America.
    Buffett deserves credit for shifting his stance to the new reality as a result of irrational policies of massive borrowing and money printing by our leaders. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) bought about 21 million shares of gold miner Barrick Gold (GOLD) spending about $563 million.
    Warren Buffett’s conversion to gold is a signal for stock market investors to also convert. Let’s examine with the help of a chart.
    The Chart
    Please click here for a chart of gold ETF (GLD).
    Gold has no earnings and does not pay a dividend. In analyzing gold, a chart is your best friend. The chart below is an annotated chart of gold ETF (GLD).
    Note the following: The chart is a monthly chart to give investors a long term perspective. As shown on the chart, gold traced a very long base. The longer the base, the more important the move. The chart shows that gold broke out from a technical perspective. The chart shows that after the breakout, gold pulled back. This is a normal behavior because gold was very overbought going into the breakout. An important factor behind the pullback in gold is the rise in interest rates. Interest rates rose from the recent low of 0.51% to about 0.71%. When interest rates are low, gold does not like higher interest rates. Interest rates will continue to be one of the biggest determinate of how gold moves. Notice the pattern traced by RSI on the chart. This is a very bullish pattern for the long term. Gold is priced in U. S. dollars. Lately the U. S. dollar has weakened and this has benefited gold. However the weak dollar has become a crowded trade and the dollar is technically oversold. For this reason, there is a setup for dollar to move higher in the short term. An up move in the dollar will put pressure on gold to the downside. The policies of the U. S. government to borrow heavily and for the Fed to keep on printing money are not likely to change. Policies of central banks and governments across the globe are similar. These policies are the main driver behind gold’s rise and perhaps the reason behind Warren Buffett’s change of heart. Due to the policies of governments and central banks, investors may want to develop the habit of watching the price of gold just like they watch stock market popular index Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Investors have been hiding into the perceived safety of five big cap tech stocks of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB). Investors should carefully watch these five stocks; if these stocks crack, some of the money seeking safety may move out of these stocks into gold. Gold is a very small market compared to the stock market. Even a small amount of inflows into gold from the big cap tech stocks may cause a big spike up in gold. Any big up move in gold may be positive for Bitcoin
    Buffett Did Not Buy Bold
    Even though the media is hyping Buffett buying gold, Buffett actually did not buy gold. He bought a gold miner with the symbol GOLD. Barrick Gold, the company Buffett bought pays dividend unlike gold.
    There is merit to buying gold stocks. However there is too much hype around Barrick Gold because of Buffett buying. Investors may consider large cap gold stock Newmont Corporation (NEM) instead of Barrick Gold. Both Barrick Gold and Newmont Corporation are on our recommended list of gold stocks. Other gold stocks on our recommended list are IAMGOLD Corporation (IAG), Yamana Gold (AUY), Royal Gold (RGLD), Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM) and Franco-Nevada Corporation (FNV). There are also silver mining stocks on the list.
    Arbitrage Trade
    In addition to long term investments in gold, silver and precious metal stocks, short term trading opportunities abound. For example, right now there is a short term trading opportunity to buy Newmont and short sell Barrick Gold. This is an arbitrage trade for those with the knowledge to take advantage of the move up in Barrick Gold stock due to Buffett related hype.
    Buffett Betting Against America
    Much has been said in the media about Buffett betting against the American economy by selling banks and buying Barrick Gold. Buffett has been selling JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC). Two important points are worth noting: Barrick Gold is a very small position for Buffett relative to his total portfolio. Buffett has been buying Bank of America (BAC).
    Caution
    Several points of caution are in order including but not limited to the following: Gold is very volatile and it should be bought when it falls into the buy zone. Gold stocks are significantly more volatile than gold. However they present a more lucrative opportunity. These stocks should be bought by scaling in the buy zones. If interest rates rise, gold may fall. If the dollar rises, gold may fall. Gold is often sold at times of distress in the stock market as investors sell anything they can to meet margin calls. Central banks hold large amounts of gold. It is conceivable that central banks may start selling their gold. Gold is a very small market and it can be easily manipulated by the governments.

    Markets
    Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is positive but can quickly move to negative if the market fails to break to a new high. Expect momo crowd to run up the market. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades.
    Interest rates are ticking down and bonds are ticking up.
    The dollar is weaker.
    Trading futures is not recommended for most investors. The purpose of providing this information is to give an indication of the premarket activity that usually guides the activity when the market opens.
    Gold futures are at $1971, silver futures are at $27.32, and oil futures are $41.94.
    S&P 500 futures resistance levels are 3390, 3420 and 3460: support levels are 3320, 3278 and 3228.
    DJIA futures are up 116 points. WHAT TO DO NOW
    Looking ahead and not only in the rear view mirror, consider continuing to hold existing core portfolio positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding cash or treasury bills 29% – 37% and short to medium-term hedges of 3% – 8% and short term hedges of 3% – 10%.

    To gain an edge, this is what you need to know now.
    FOMC Minutes
    FOMC (Fed) minutes were released at 2:00 pm ET. We brought this to your attention in the Morning Capsule. The minutes caused heavy selling but the momo crowd bought the dip.
    Let’s explore with the help of a three minute chart. Note the following:
    Please click here for the three minute chart of ETF SPY. The chart shows when FOMC minutes were released. The chart shows selling on release of the minutes. Take a look at the volume increase during the selling. VUD indicator is the most sensitive measure of net supply demand in real time. Orange indicates more supply of stocks than demand for stocks. Green indicates more demand for stocks than supply. A very important observation is that the VUD indicator did not turn orange until 25 minutes after the announcement. The reason (very complex algorithms and charts not shown for the sake of readability) is that the momo crowd was buying throughout the selling. The chart shows the momo crowd buying after the dip. The chart shows that the VUD indicator stayed negative even when the prices moved up. This indicates that the momo crowd is extremely aggressive in buying whereas sellers are very cautious in selling. This is also a very important observation.
    FOMC Salient Points
    Here are the salient points from the FOMC minutes. FOMC is very concerned about the protracted recovery period for the economy. This is in sharp contrast to the stock market bulls who believe that the positive economic data we have been seeing will continue in a ‘V’ shape. Banks are tightening lending standards further. There is a serious risk to financial stability.
    Logically, these FOMC minutes were bearish and should have caused significant selling. But don’t tell that to the momo crowd; to them ‘bad news is good news’.
    Money Flows
    The momo crowd money flows since the Morning Capsule are very positive. Smart money flows since the Morning Capsule are negative.
    Short squeeze money flows are positive.
    A Special Note To New Subscribers
    Note the smart money behavior. Smart money tends to sell into strength on strong up days.
    New subscribers should consider adopting smart money’s way of investing and trading. Sentiment
    Sentiment is very positive. Sentiment is a contrary indicator at extremes. In plain English, this means that when sentiment becomes extremely positive it is time to sell and when sentiment becomes extremely negative it is time to buy.
    Gold
    The momo crowd money flows in gold are negative since the Morning Capsule.
    Smart money flows are neutral in gold since the Morning Capsule.
    The momo crowd money flows are very negative in silver since the Morning Capsule.
    The momo crowd money flows are negative in miners since the Morning Capsule.
    Smart money flows are neutral in silver and miners.
    Oil
    The momo crowd money flows in oil are positive since the Morning Capsule.
    Smart money flows in oil are negative since the Morning Capsule.
    Errata: The API data in the Morning Capsule referred to ‘draw’, this has been corrected.
    Buy Zones And Buy Now Ratings
    Those who meet the protection band criteria as outlined in the Morning Capsule and are underinvested may consider continuing to lightly scale in based on buy zones and ‘Buy Now’ ratings of individual securities.
    Any buying should be strategic and not tactical unless there are specific recent signals given.
    It is a mistake to buy all in at one time. Please see Trade Management Guidelines.
    Nibbling
    Consider not nibbling at this time if you are under invested and there is significant room in your protection band criteria.
    Nibbling refers to buying very small quantities, often in existing long term positions with the intention of exiting these additions in the short term. It is similar to trade around positions but without specific signals.
    Close
    There appear to be sell on close orders but buy orders appear to be coming in as we finish this post.
    There is merit to watching the pattern of market on close orders as they represent the day’s dominant net cumulative activity by many professionals and funds.
    The Afternoon Capsule is not published daily but only when conditions warrant it. The content below is unchanged and is to be used for reference as needed.
    Sophistication
    Many investors are spoiled due to the decade long bull market. Many believe it is very simple – be all in or be all out. Unfortunately, the last decade was an exception to the rule.
    As the market is running up, investors who do not understand the true nature of the market are jumping in with both feet without appreciating the risks.
    Risk and reward are two sides to the coin. It is important to consider both.
    For your reference, we are pasting the following from your Getting A Running Start Guide,
    Everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler. Albert Einstein
    Strategic Vs. Tactical
    All investors should consider bringing more sophistication to their investing and trading. It is important to clearly understand the difference between strategic and tactical calls. For your convenience, a prior post is pasted below. ASK ARORA: CASH AND HEDGES: UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL CALLS February 5, 2020
    Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora .
    We have written previously about the importance of understanding the difference between strategic calls and tactical calls.
    We welcome your comments and questions. The law does not allow us to answer them individually. However, when a large number of subscribers ask similar questions, a post is done. Typically starting with Ask Arora.
    Based on the questions received this morning, a refresher on understanding the difference between strategy and tactics is in order.
    Strategy
    Strategy defines medium to long term plan to achieve the highest risk adjusted returns.
    Tactics
    Tactics are small adjustments within the strategy to further enhance risk adjusted returns.
    If You Could Pick Only One
    We recognize that all investors have individual preferences. If you could pick only one, consider focusing on the strategy. Never focus only on tactics at the expense of strategy.
    Strategic Call
    The strategic call at this time is to stay cautiously bullish. The logic is very straightforward. Consider the following key points: The stock market has been going straight up for 10 years. It is late cycle. Portfolios have to be organized for the late cycle. Risks are much higher in the late cycle compared to when a bull market is in an early stage. The world is awash in debt. The sovereign debt owed by governments and corporate debt owed by zombie corporations has dramatically increased. It is a bubble that is getting bigger waiting for a pin to prick it. Valuations are expensive. A big reason for levitation of the stock market is money printing by the central banks. This can continue for a long time but not forever.
    Tactical Calls
    Tactical calls are simply short term adjustments. For example, a tactical call to decrease cash and hedges is based on the following: Weak hands temporarily washed out overbought condition. Overbought condition temporarily relieved. Sentiment backing off from almost extreme bullish levels. Overall better earnings.
    Cash And Hedges
    We provide a range for cash and hedges. Most investors would be in the middle of the ranges. As such, they would not need to make any change. When a change is given only at the edges of the ranges, only the most active investors need to make a change.
    Arora’s 12th Law
    Arora’s 12th Law is applicable here: To be successful at investing and trading, flow with the new data and stay nimble.
    Bullet Proof Your Portfolio And Increase Your Returns
    We consistently see that private investors, money managers and investment advisors who have attended the Bullet Proof Your Portfolio and Increase Your Returns seminar do significantly better compared to those who have not attended the seminar.
    Here are the four main reasons why this consistently happens to investors who attend the seminar: They start understanding the true nature of the markets. Develop a better framework to handle the true nature of the market. Tend to act with more conviction and with more comfort. Tend to develop a better control over their emotions. ",

    New High
    S&P 500 made a new high but so far there is nothing to write home about. Let’s explore with the help of a chart.
    Please click here for a chart of S&P 500 ETF (SPY). This is the shortest bear market in history. The chart shows that the new high is only nominal. It is barely visible on the chart. RSI shows that the stock market has lost momentum in the process of making this nominal new high. RSI measures the internal momentum. The volume is low. This indicates lack of conviction. This is a dismal way to make a new high in spite of aggressive buying by the momo crowd. In a normal market, we would be issuing a sell signal based on this behavior. However this market is not a normal market. It is an artificial market driven by excessive money printing and borrowing. Both money printing and borrowing are likely to continue. Moreover there is hope for vaccine which can drive the market higher. So far the economic data is coming better than expected. This may be due to pent up demand. If that is the case, economic data should weaken going forward.
    Bubble Getting Bigger
    At this time, the call remains that the bubble is likely to get bigger.
    The measured target remains 3800 on S&P 500 (SPX) or 380 on ETF SPY. S&P 500 is trading around 3389 as of this writing.

    text: "Warren Buffett has an enviable long-term record in the stock market, although in recent years his performance has been less impressive.
    Lately some newer investors in the momo (momentum) crowd that’s controlling this stock market have criticized Buffett. However, Buffett’s latest move shows that he is as sharp as ever.
    Buffett has not been a fan of gold. As a matter of fact, he has often derided the precious metal. To the dismay of gold bugs, Buffett has been the de facto leader of the anti-gold crowd. There has been a belief that investing in gold was akin to betting against America.
    Buffett deserves credit for shifting his stance to the new reality as a result of the irrational policies of massive borrowing and money printing by U.S. leaders. Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A bought about 21 million shares of gold miner Barrick Gold GOLD, spending about $563 million. That’s according to a filing released Aug. 14.
    Buffett’s conversion to gold is a signal for other stock market investors.
    Let’s examine this issue. Please click here for a bigger chart of gold ETF (GLD) that will help you.
    Gold has no earnings and does not pay a dividend. In analyzing gold, a chart is your best friend. Above is an annotated chart of SPDR Gold Shares GLD, an exchange traded fund. You may have to enlarge the image.
    Note the following:
    • The chart is monthly, giving investors a long-term perspective.
    • Gold traced a very long base. The longer the base, the more important the move.
    • Gold broke out from a technical perspective.
    • After the breakout, gold pulled back. This is a normal behavior because gold was very overbought going into the breakout.
    • An important factor behind the pullback in gold is the rise in interest rates. Interest rates rose from the recent low of 0.51% to about 0.71%. When interest rates are low, gold does not like higher interest rates. Interest rates will continue to be one of the biggest determinants of how gold moves.
    • Notice the pattern traced by RSI (relative strength index). This is a bullish pattern for the long term.
    • Gold is priced in U.S. dollars. Lately the U.S. dollar has weakened and this has benefited gold. However, the weak dollar has become a crowded trade and is now technically oversold. For this reason, there is a setup for the dollar to move higher in the short term. A rise in the dollar will put pressure on gold to the downside.
    • The policies of the U.S. government to borrow heavily and for the Federal Reserve to keep on printing money are not likely to change. Policies of central banks and governments across the globe are similar. These policies are the main driver behind gold’s rise and perhaps the reason behind Warren Buffett’s change of heart.
    • Due to the policies of governments and central banks, investors may want to develop the habit of watching the price of gold just like they watch stock indexes.
    • Gold is a very small market compared with the stock market. Even a small amount of inflows into gold from large-cap tech stocks may cause a big spike in gold.
    • Any big move up in gold may be positive for bitcoin BTCUSD…. Read more at MarketWatch .

    To gain an edge, this is what you need to know now.
    Americans Buy More Than Pre-virus
    In today’s Morning Capsule we shared with you Retail Sales data. An interesting insight is that last month Americans bought more than they did pre virus.
    The important interpretation is that the Fed is being too aggressive with its money printing — more than what the economy needs, and the government has borrowed more for various programs to counter coronavirus than it needed.
    It is mind boggling why the government is unable to narrowly tailor programs that are directed at only those who have been hurt by coronavirus that need help. Not many politicians even talk about narrowly tailored programs.
    Standoff Is Not Normal
    So far it is another day of standoff between bulls and bears near a new all time high in S&P 500. Historically, such behavior is not normal. Typically either the market backs off or it punches through the old high.
    This behavior is extraordinary considering the power of the momo crowd especially since the March low.
    China Trade Talks Postponed
    Trade talks with China originally set for this weekend have been postponed. The purpose of the talks was to review progress at the six month interval of the trade agreement.
    Money Flows
    The momo crowd money flows since the Morning Capsule are positive. Smart money flows since the Morning Capsule are negative.
    Short squeeze money flows are positive.
    A Special Note To New Subscribers
    Note the smart money behavior. Smart money tends to sell into strength on strong up days.
    New subscribers should consider adopting smart money’s way of investing and trading. Sentiment
    Sentiment is very positive. Sentiment is a contrary indicator at extremes. In plain English, this means that when sentiment becomes extremely positive it is time to sell and when sentiment becomes extremely negative it is time to buy.
    Gold
    The momo crowd money flows in gold are negative since the Morning Capsule.
    Smart money flows are neutral in gold since the Morning Capsule.
    The momo crowd money flows in silver and miners are negative since the Morning Capsule.
    Smart money flows are neutral in silver and miners since the Morning Capsule.
    Oil
    The momo crowd money flows in oil are positive since the Morning Capsule.
    Smart money flows in oil are neutral since the Morning Capsule.
    Buy Zones And Buy Now Ratings
    Those who meet the protection band criteria as outlined in the Morning Capsule and are underinvested may consider continuing to lightly scale in based on buy zones and ‘Buy Now’ ratings of individual securities.
    Any buying should be strategic and not tactical unless there are specific recent signals given.
    It is a mistake to buy all in at one time. Please see Trade Management Guidelines.
    Nibbling
    Consider not nibbling at this time if you are under invested and there is significant room in your protection band criteria.
    Nibbling refers to buying very small quantities, often in existing long term positions with the intention of exiting these additions in the short term. It is similar to trade around positions but without specific signals.
    Close
    There appear to be buy on close orders.
    There is merit to watching the pattern of market on close orders as they represent the day’s dominant net cumulative activity by many professionals and funds.
    The Afternoon Capsule is not published daily but only when conditions warrant it. The content below is unchanged and is to be used for reference as needed.
    Sophistication
    Many investors are spoiled due to the decade long bull market. Many believe it is very simple – be all in or be all out. Unfortunately, the last decade was an exception to the rule.
    As the market is running up, investors who do not understand the true nature of the market are jumping in with both feet without appreciating the risks.
    Risk and reward are two sides to the coin. It is important to consider both.
    For your reference, we are pasting the following from your Getting A Running Start Guide,
    Everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler. Albert Einstein
    Strategic Vs. Tactical
    All investors should consider bringing more sophistication to their investing and trading. It is important to clearly understand the difference between strategic and tactical calls. For your convenience, a prior post is pasted below. ASK ARORA: CASH AND HEDGES: UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL CALLS February 5, 2020
    Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora .
    We have written previously about the importance of understanding the difference between strategic calls and tactical calls.
    We welcome your comments and questions. The law does not allow us to answer them individually. However, when a large number of subscribers ask similar questions, a post is done. Typically starting with Ask Arora.
    Based on the questions received this morning, a refresher on understanding the difference between strategy and tactics is in order.
    Strategy
    Strategy defines medium to long term plan to achieve the highest risk adjusted returns.
    Tactics
    Tactics are small adjustments within the strategy to further enhance risk adjusted returns.
    If You Could Pick Only One
    We recognize that all investors have individual preferences. If you could pick only one, consider focusing on the strategy. Never focus only on tactics at the expense of strategy.
    Strategic Call
    The strategic call at this time is to stay cautiously bullish. The logic is very straightforward. Consider the following key points: The stock market has been going straight up for 10 years. It is late cycle. Portfolios have to be organized for the late cycle. Risks are much higher in the late cycle compared to when a bull market is in an early stage. The world is awash in debt. The sovereign debt owed by governments and corporate debt owed by zombie corporations has dramatically increased. It is a bubble that is getting bigger waiting for a pin to prick it. Valuations are expensive. A big reason for levitation of the stock market is money printing by the central banks. This can continue for a long time but not forever.
    Tactical Calls
    Tactical calls are simply short term adjustments. For example, a tactical call to decrease cash and hedges is based on the following: Weak hands temporarily washed out overbought condition. Overbought condition temporarily relieved. Sentiment backing off from almost extreme bullish levels. Overall better earnings.
    Cash And Hedges
    We provide a range for cash and hedges. Most investors would be in the middle of the ranges. As such, they would not need to make any change. When a change is given only at the edges of the ranges, only the most active investors need to make a change.
    Arora’s 12th Law
    Arora’s 12th Law is applicable here: To be successful at investing and trading, flow with the new data and stay nimble.
    Bullet Proof Your Portfolio And Increase Your Returns
    We consistently see that private investors, money managers and investment advisors who have attended the Bullet Proof Your Portfolio and Increase Your Returns seminar do significantly better compared to those who have not attended the seminar.
    Here are the four main reasons why this consistently happens to investors who attend the seminar: They start understanding the true nature of the markets. Develop a better framework to handle the true nature of the market. Tend to act with more conviction and with more comfort. Tend to develop a better control over their emotions. ",

I see a number of firms can operate offering customers finance without the need of FCA authorisation and a consumer credit licence is not required. No idea how that would work for Amigo?

    title: "Health Fresh Meals competes in growing meal delivery market",
    text: "Some of us are shot out of a cannon as we enter adulthood. Those achievers are focused, polished, confident and have a career in their crosshairs. The rest of us bounce among jobs and interests for a while, discovering our talents. We experiment and feel our way as we search — even stumble — toward our ”calling.”
    Shana Greenbaum, 34, was a searcher. The entrepreneur tried competitive ice skating, waiting on tables and hostessing, restaurant management, a bit of acting, and even bodybuilding before she founded her food delivery business four years ago.
    Greenbaum’s Healthy Fresh Meals delivers more than 4,000 servings every week to around 500 customers — including health-conscious gym rats and a sprinkling of professional athletes — throughout the Washington-Baltimore market. The average meal is about $12.
    AD AD The menu changes weekly. A recent week included several offerings, such as Thai coconut curry salmon for the average consumers or steak, sweet potato and broccoli for the athletic crowd.
    “The food business suits me,” the businesswoman said. “We will see how this turns out after covid, but I own a building, I have a business and I am going to do something with it.”
    Sweat DC makes a hard pivot to outlast pandemic
    Greenbaum’s staff cooks the meals and heat-seals them in recyclable trays designed to keep them fresh for a week with refrigeration. About 90 percent of the clients are households. Some buy an entire week’s worth of lunches and dinners that are delivered on Sunday by a small army of drivers. The rest of the orders go to businesses and are delivered on Monday. Customers pay a $10 delivery charge that covers all the meals for the week, whether it’s one or 50.
    AD AD Greenbaum’s finances are solid.
    The Washington native expects to gross somewhere north of $2 million this year, clearing a 10 percent-plus net profit and pocketing more than $100,000 for herself. The rest of the profit goes back into the business.
    She keeps headcount low: Healthy Fresh Meals staffs about 25 people, including four full-time employees, a dozen kitchen staffers and more than 10 drivers.
    Her only debt is the $700,000 mortgage on her Hyattsville kitchen/headquarters (including her beloved, $50,000 walk-in refrigerator). The monthly mortgage payment is less than what she was paying to lease space in a shared kitchen.
    “I save money, and I earn equity in real estate,” she said.
    Shares by the slice: Fractional investing sparks a stock market stampede
    As is common with most owners of small businesses, she does much of the work herself and occasionally enlists family and friends to help. Her husband, a staffer on Capitol Hill, created the sign that hangs next to the front door of her building. Her friend since childhood is her chief troubleshooter.
    AD AD Healthy Fresh’s clients include the D.C. United soccer team, some National Football League players around the region and at least one local university. She is waiting to hear whether a big, health-oriented organization will become a client. If it pans out, the deal could add prestige and $500,000 a year in new orders.
    Greenbaum is comfortable in the business world. Her late father’s family bought, renovated and flipped Washington residential real estate. Her mom helped homeschool her and encouraged her aspiration to be a competitive ice skater, which was sidelined with an injury at 17.
    She isn’t afraid to try new things. While a student at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in Los Angeles, she introduced herself to some film production assistants. That led to a side hustle in films and commercials. She had very small parts as an extra in “Transformers 2” and Renee Zellweger’s “My One and Only.” She kept it up upon returning to the East Coast in 2006, even earning $4,000 for one week’s work.
    Southwest Soda Pop Shop: How a side business became the main attraction
    The food business has been part of her life since she was 18 and tending bar at Guapo’s Mexican-themed chain. She spent 13 years, off and on including during college, helping a fellow bartender launch his own Tex-Mex restaurant group in Richmond called Chicken Fiesta.
    AD AD “I did everything from cashier, cook, cleaning tables to handling marketing and customer service,” Greenbaum said. “I grew and managed their catering and scouted and helped open other locations.”
    Ask anyone in the hospitality business, and they will tell you the work can be relentless and exhausting. Greenbaum’s “aha” moment came while eating in the kitchen of one of her friend’s Richmond restaurants.
    It was time to reboot her life.
    “I was tired of not being healthy,” she said. “I went to a gym. I started bodybuilding. I gave myself a goal of getting in shape in 16 weeks.”
    With modern thinking, antique lighting retains its luster
    Her mother, who also had been a bodybuilder, advised Shana to clean up her diet.
    AD “Mom said, ‘You have to meal prep,’ ” Greenbaum recalls. The chefs at Chicken Fiesta taught her to make chicken, broccoli and rice. She ate the same thing every day for four months.
    AD Meal prep business started trickling in. The restaurateur/boss asked Shana to make 14 meals a week for him. Then her aunt, who owns several restaurants herself, wanted in.
    She quickly had about 10 clients that were ordering through emails and text messages.
    “Random people actually started calling, and I said, ‘Oh my gosh. I have real customers.’ I didn’t know my capabilities, but I wanted to turn this into something.”
    She charged $10 a meal and delivered most of them personally in her Hyundai Veloster hatchback. She soon moved to her parents’ home, where her mom sauteed peppers, her dad cut tomatoes, and her brother made kabobs, packaged and delivered.
    AD “My family was part of my journey,” she said.
    Soapbox sees explosive growth in pandemic-era pivot
    Launching Healthy Fresh Meals was an unglamorous grind.
    Greenbaum built her own website and practices what she calls, “guerilla marketing”: cold-calling the front desks of gyms, fitness and supplement retailers, and even her best friend’s hairdressing salon, looking for new customers and posting flyers. She still invests hours at food festivals such as Taste of Arlington.
    AD She scoured Google for food equipment and supplies.
    “I can find anything through Google,” she said. “I would be a good private investigator.”
    She gave a friend a free month of meals for helping her incorporate on LegalZoom.
    Not everything went smoothly. It took some time to streamline food purchases and figure out how to cook only once a week and still keep the food fresh. She wasted $900 on a faulty machine that was supposed to automate her packaging. Not one to be wasteful, she paid a friend to seal the plastic trays she had purchased with a hot clothes iron until she found better machines.
    ‘We saw this coming’: Flock is a case study in riding out the coronavirus economy
    By the end of 2016, she was delivering 400 meals a week and grossing $350,000 a year. That doubled the next year, and she is pushing above $2 million for 2020.
    Competition in the meal business is fierce, especially with the coronavirus pandemic that has closed restaurants and kept diners home. But Greenbaum’s attention to costs and the bottom line could make her one of the survivors.
    “I refuse to fail,” Greenbaum said.
    But she is keeping her options open. “Even if this doesn’t work out, I have several other business ideas in the works.”",

    I noticed the same thing as you which is that it takes wealth to accumulate wealth and as you have more wealth, it becomes easier to accumulate more with little work or effort. I also noticed that everything accelerates once you get more wealth and once you get to 1M, the next 1M doesn't seem too far off. It also changed me. I became less frugal, less concerned about saving enough for retirement, and more relaxed in my lifestyle. I took more risk with my savings and some have yielded amazing results and some have not. I diversified a lot more and invested in real estate and business ventures. The bulk of my savings are still in cash and the stock market and it will sustain me in me in my retirement.",

    text: "The bully pulpit: Trump pushes Washington, but virus resists by Jonathan Lemire And Aamer Madhani, Posted Aug 22, 2020 8:41 am MDT Last Updated Aug 22, 2020 at 8:44 am MDT FILE - In this March 11, 2020, file photo President Donald Trump addresses the nation from the Oval Office at the White House in Washington.

    WASHINGTON — His face framed by the golden Oval Office curtains behind him, President Donald Trump stared straight into the camera aimed at the Resolute Desk.
    It was the night of March 11, 2020. And Trump’s presidency would be forever changed.
    Trump, whose improbable election ripped up the rules of American politics, had spent three-plus years defying history and orthodoxy in a chaotic spectacle that dominated the national discourse and fervently engaged both sides of a bitterly divided country. And now, essentially for the first time, he was confronted by a crisis that was not of his own making.
    It was the kind of test presidents inevitably must face, and Trump responded with trademark certitude.
    “The virus will not have a chance against us,” Trump told Americans that night.
    Five months later, the coronavirus has killed more than 175,000 Americans and left tens of millions unemployed. And now, as Trump prepares to again accept the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday in a ceremony at the White House, he must convince an electorate that has largely disapproved of his handling of the pandemic that he is not to blame, deserves another term and that all the chaos has been worth it.
    “The future of our country and indeed our civilization is at stake on Nov. 3,” Trump said Friday.
    Trump has spent his presidency bending Washington to his will. He has transformed a public health crisis into a political litmus test. He has presided over a booming, if stratified, economy, and claimed he created it. He has again forced race to the centre of the American conversation, using federal police to enforce his view. He has alienated historic allies and changed how much of the world views the United States.
    At seminal moments — in set speeches, impromptu riffs and long-sought policy reversals, examined in this story — he has redefined, at least temporarily, the presidency.
    But he has not shaken the virus.
    ___
    THE ADDRESS
    A virus born in China had swept through Europe and reached America’s shores. Global markets were tumbling, hospitals filling, cities locking down. On the day the coronavirus was officially declared a pandemic, beloved actor Tom Hanks announced he had tested positive. The NBA suspended its season.
    And for only the second time as president, Trump addressed the nation in a formal Oval Office speech. His spoke slowly, his voice halting, and he seemed unsure of what to do with his hands.
    The U.S., he told Americans, would “expeditiously defeat this virus.” But by any measure, Trump’s address didn’t go over well: The White House had to correct significant errors — one on travel from Europe, another on international cargo — within minutes of the speech’s conclusion.
    And ever since, the virus has proven impervious to bullying tweets or the ability to dictate cable news chyrons. It has upended American politics, stripping Trump of both his most potent reelection argument, a strong economy, and the venues from which to extol it, his raucous campaign rallies.
    “Historically, demagogic power wanes when seismic events overwhelm the existing moment,” said presidential historian Jon Meacham. “Pearl Harbor crushed America First; Bloody Sunday helped break the grip of Jim Crow. The pandemic may be the seismic shift, the mind-concentrating challenge, that ends Trump’s appeal beyond his hard-core base.”
    Until now, one of Trump’s greatest skills as a politician has been to assert his own political reality, careening from headline to headline, while seemingly able to dodge scandals that would likely have ended any other political career.
    His 2016 campaign was chaos and it worked, in part due to the unpopularity of Hillary Clinton, as well as outside help both foreign (Moscow) and domestic (James Comey). The Russia investigation shadowed him throughout his first two years in office. His response: an unrelenting assault from the Oval Office on the investigators and intelligence agencies.
    In the end, special counsel Robert Mueller did not find that Trump conspired with Moscow to interfere with the election, but he also did not exonerate the president on possible charges of obstruction of justice. Trump claimed total victory. Several key aides ended up with guilty pleas, yet the president emerged relatively unscathed — only soon to enter another maelstrom over foreign help, this time his request to Ukraine to investigate his eventual Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.
    Somehow, Trump’s block-the-sun response made the third impeachment of a sitting president feel like both a foregone conclusion and an afterthought.
    He had, again, survived. But the day after his acquittal also brought an ominous milestone: the nation’s first COVID-19 death.
    ___
    THE CRASH
    When Trump made the trip to the Capitol for his State of the Union address in February, he was buoyed by polling that showed the impeachment proceedings had turned out to have little impact and Americans approved of his handling of the economy.
    “Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again,” Trump declared.
    The numbers did look good. And Trump aides were quick to credit his sweeping tax cut, one of his signature first-term achievements.
    The unemployment rate was hovering at 3.5%, a level not seen since the 1960s. The stock market, one of the president’s favourite measures of economic success, was up roughly 20% from the previous year. And workers, particularly in lower-paying jobs, were seeing wages tick up.
    Trump’s campaign advisers were giddy over signs that his message was resonating beyond the voters who had helped him win 2016. Advisers took note of the significant number of people requesting tickets to Trump rallies who hadn’t voted in the last presidential election.
    Since 1956, in the 12 months before presidential elections, only one of nine incumbent presidents lost when unemployment fell over that year (Gerald Ford in 1976), and only one was reelected when it rose (Dwight Eisenhower in 1956).
    Then came the virus.
    In a matter of weeks, the economy collapsed. Unemployment skyrocketed to 14.7% and all the gains made by the stock market since he won reelection were erased.
    The virus-weakened economy has shown some signs of improvement but it is far from being healed. Unemployment has edged down to 10.2% — still just below the peak of U.S. joblessness in the Great Recession — and the S&P 500 reached a new high.
    But the suffering for a huge slice of America remains great. More than 40% of recent layoffs are likely to become permanent job losses, by one recent estimate. The National Restaurant Association forecasts the industry could lose 5 to 7 million employees. And if the White House and Congress don’t come to terms on another aid package, the economy could go sideways after Labor Day.
    Still, Trump’s backers believe he has an argument to make.
    “I think the message needs to be in post-COVID times: Trump has got the energy, the stamina, the experience and track record to bring us back,” said Dan Eberhart, chief executive of oil services company Canary LLC and a major Republican donor.
    But with less than 10 weeks to go until Election Day, Trump has spent an inordinate amount of time on squabbles and distractions, bashing the U.S. Postal Service, warning “suburban housewives” about perceived threats to their neighbourhood idylls from affordable housing, lending credence to the right-wing QAnon conspiracy movement.
    “I don’t know what persuadable voter is moved by anti-Post Office rhetoric,” Eberhart said. “We’ve got to get the closing message right.”
    ___
    THE NEWS CONFERENCE
    Under a glistening ballroom chandelier, reporters packed into Trump’s Bedminster country club in New Jersey, waiting for the president to address shocking events that had unfolded more than 300 miles to the south on a sweltering day in August 2017.
    A clash in Charlottesville, Virginia, between white supremacists and anti-racism demonstrators had left a young woman dead, mowed down by a neo-Nazi who drove his car into a crowd of counter protesters. Trump’s response: There was hatred and bigotry on “many sides.” Days later, in a Trump Tower news conference, he again declined to denounce solely the white supremacists, speaking of “very fine people on both sides.”
    His equivocal words roiled the White House. Senior West Wing advisers threatened to quit. Republicans found their voices and condemned Trump.
    It was more than just a moment. Trump, a billionaire by some accounts, sold himself to voters as an unlikely champion of the forgotten man who would “Make America Great Again,” a slogan that was read by many as a callback to a simpler — and whiter — era in the United States.
    The president’s team showcased record low unemployment rates for African Americans and rising prosperity for minorities in the days before the pandemic. But his rhetoric and policies were viewed by many as offensive and, at times, racist.
    There was his campaign kickoff suggestion that many Mexican immigrants were “rapists.” His claim that an Indiana-born judge couldn’t be impartial because of his Latino heritage. And there was the racist lie of birtherism — Trump’s false suggestions that President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the U.S. and thus wasn’t eligible to be president.
    His moves to sharply curtail legal and illegal immigration became a frequent fault line for the administration. Thousands of Americans protested at airports in January 2017 when the White House enacted its first ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries, demonstrations that foreshadowed the uproar the following summer when the administration moved to forcibly separate migrant families at the southern border, leading to television images of weeping children pulled from their parents. And his closing — and ultimately failed — argument before the 2018 midterm elections was that dangerous caravans of migrants were headed for U.S. cities.
    “He has made explicit what has been fueling American politics since the 1960s. He is saying the quiet parts out loud,” said Eddie Glaude, chair of the department of African American studies at Princeton University. “He has made direct appeals to white grievance, to white resentment. He has dwelled in the underbelly of American politics.”
    Trump’s poll numbers, already wobbling, fell further in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer.
    As protests calling for racial justice erupted, Trump leaned in on his law-and-order cry, depicting demonstrators as “thugs.” References to Lafayette Square, the park across from the White House, now evoke images of Trump posing in front of a damaged church holding up a Bible after officers forcefully routed demonstrators from the area.
    ___
    THE SUMMIT
    Vladimir Putin smiled.
    The world was watching a post-summit news conference by the American and Russian leaders in Helsinki in July 2018, and Trump had just publicly sided with Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies on the question of election interference.
    The uproar was immediate. Even before Air Force One took off for Washington, Trump’s comments were condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike.
    Trump’s deference to Putin, beyond reviving questions about the American leader’s possible ties to Moscow, illuminated his own brand of foreign policy, one that has strained ties with Western allies, in favour of transactional relationships and a warmth toward strongmen.
    “Trump came into office believing that the cost of American world leadership was far greater than the benefits,” said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “He sees allies as economic competitors rather than strategic partners.”
    It all adds up to foreign policy wins, in the view of Trump supporters. After his prodding, more NATO members boosted spending on defence. The Islamic State, which once controlled 34,000 square miles in Syria and Iraq, has been defanged. And North Korea, which at the start of Trump’s term was widely regarded as the most volatile foreign policy issue on his plate, has remained relatively quiet.
    “We have two foreign policy presidents with Trump,” said James Carafano, national security expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “There is the showman Trump and there is the serious foreign policy Trump. We spend way too much time focusing on the showmanship.”
    Outside of Trump’s links to Putin, no relationship has attracted more scrutiny than the president’s hot-cold ties with China’s Xi Jinping.
    Trump campaigned as a China hawk but, after being feted on an extravagant state visit to Beijing, his tone softened and he was eager to strike a new trade deal. And when the virus began to ignite around Wuhan, the president was reluctant to endanger negotiations and thus slow to criticize China.
    Those days of expedient restraint are long gone, replaced by Trump’s determination to affix blame elsewhere for the pandemic that has imperiled his presidency. The coronavirus, in Trump’s telling, became the “China virus.”

    TRUTH AND CONSEQUENCE
    No one knew when Trump arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina, on March 3, that it might turn out to be the last jam-packed, big stadium rally of his presidency.
    At that point in the crisis — more than a week before the government recommended Americans sharply curtail activities to slow the spread of the virus — the number of U.S. infections had surpassed 100 and six people were confirmed dead. Trump assured the 9,600-person crowd that night he was leaning on the “greatest professionals in the world” to advise him.
    “My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and that’s what I’ll do,” declared Trump. He added, “America is so resilient, we know what we’re doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth.”
    Over the course of his presidency, Trump has leaned hard on florid overstatement, misdirection and out-right lies.
    It was a pattern set on his first full day in office when he ordered his press secretary to exaggerate the crowd size at his 2017 inauguration. Since then, he incorrectly claimed the Mueller report “totally exonerated” him, he insisted his administration was “taxing the hell out of China” even as the trade deficit grew, and he promised a sweeping health care plan that has yet to emerge.
    But his declaration at the Charlotte rally that he was getting advice from some of the greatest minds in medicine rang true. His coronavirus task force included Dr. Anthony Fauci, a renowned infectious disease expert, and Dr. Deborah Birx, who had worked with Fauci for years combating HIV/AIDS globally. Their presence gave the medical community hope that Trump would let the scientists lead him and the country through the crisis, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University.
    Trump, in both private life and in the West Wing, has always made himself the centre of power, the structure likened to “a wheel where all the spokes lead to the centre, directly to the president,” according to Chris Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax and a longtime friend of Trump.
    “There was no hierarchy at Trump Org and his White House mirrors that because, for Trump, it’s never been about organization, it is all about results,” said Ruddy.
    Reinforcing that, the Trump White House has seen an unprecedented amount of turnover among senior staff and Cabinet members, many of whom sharply criticized the president after leaving. And Trump soon began to break with the medical experts.
    “He won the benefit of the doubt in the public health community because he surrounded himself with the people who would follow the science,” Gostin said. “The problem is, it doesn’t matter if you have the right people around you if don’t listen them.”
    Trump, in defiance of federal guidelines, pushed for a rapid reopening of the economy even as public health experts warned him to go slow.
    He promoted the use of the drug hydroxychloroquine as a “game changer,” and even used it himself, despite federal warnings against taking the malaria drug to combat COVID-19. He regularly asserts that the virus will soon “go away.” And he recently dismissed a warning by the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, that the U.S. could be in for “the worst fall, from a public health perspective, we’ve ever had” if Americans don’t step up mitigation efforts, such as wearing masks.
    “I think that we’re doing very well,” Trump said. “We’re on our way.”
    That’s the bravado that Trump has projected throughout his presidency. He frequently proclaims that no president, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, has accomplished as much as he has.
    He’s moved the federal judicial system far to the right with the appointment of two conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court and more than 200 federal judges to lower courts. And he’s built more than 200 miles of his planned U.S.-Mexico wall, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign promise to slow illegal immigration.
    But in the end, Trump has often ended up his own worst enemy, unwilling or unable to check his impulses. The campaign he now faces is less a choice between candidates than a referendum on himself, a weighting he will try to reverse before November.
    And his most lasting legacy might be undermining Americans’ trust in institutions, said Brian Ott, who heads the communication department at Missouri State University and has done extensive research on the president’s social media rhetoric.
    “He has waged war on science, fact and truth,” Ott said. “He has, in short, debased the office he holds and the entire nation with his endless lying.”

    The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Tuesday, wiping out losses from the coronavirus-induced sell-off and returning the market to pre-pandemic levels.
    But while the index is right back where it started before the virus sent the market plunging, a CNBC analysis shows that the majority of stocks have yet to climb back to their prior levels. While the overall market crashed and then reached new heights between its previous high on Feb. 19 and new high on Aug. 18, only 38% of stocks in the index made gains over that time period. A majority, the remaining 62%, were negative.
    In many cases, these still-reeling stocks are down significantly from where they were in February. While there have been a number of big winners — 43 stocks in total saw gains of 25% or more, including health care and technology names like ABIOMED (87%), PayPal (57%), and Amazon (53%) — there have been far more big losers.
    A quarter of the index, 126 stocks in total, saw declines of 25% or more compared to the Feb. 19 starting point. Norwegian Cruise Lines (-71%), Occidental Petroleum (-67%), and Carnival Corporation (-67%) are the top three laggards over the period.
    In an interview on CNBC following Tuesday’s record close, Michael Yoshikami, CEO of Destination Wealth Management, described a “shift in demand” that explains why stocks haven’t moved in unison since the market’s last record.
    “It’s not as if everything is rising,” he said. “You pull money out of names that really aren’t attractive given current conditions. And that money moves over to companies that are thriving in this environment.”
    As Yoshikami described, stocks in some sectors have fared better than others. In consumer staples, health care, and information technology, more than 50% of stocks posted gains between Feb. 19 and Aug. 18. In energy and utilities, however, less than 10% did so.
    But even within individual sectors, performance has not been uniform. Tech stocks, for example, which rose 12% from prior high to new high and are an oft-cited explanation for the stock market’s incredible comeback, saw wide-ranging performance. On one end of the spectrum, PayPal and Nvidia each rose by more than 50%, while on the other end Western Digital and Xerox both fell just as steeply.
    In the health care sector, performance varied just as widely. Abiomed led all stocks in the index with an 87% gain from Feb. 19 to Aug. 18, and West Pharmaceuticals and Regeneron, at 58% and 54%, were also among the top performers. But more than 40% of stocks in the sector were down, including Dentsply Sirona (-26%), Universal Health Services (-19%), and Cigna (-18%).
    The one area in which stocks have shown alignment is throughout the market’s return from the S&P 500’s March 23 low point, when the index rose by 52% en route to the new record high. Over that surge, just six stocks — Coty Inc., FirstEnergy, Walgreens, Gilead Sciences, Wells Fargo, and Intel — were negative.",

    text: "WASHINGTON (AP) — His face framed by the golden Oval Office curtains behind him, President Donald Trump stared straight into the camera aimed at the Resolute Desk.
    It was the night of March 11, 2020. And Trump’s presidency would be forever changed.
    Trump, whose improbable election ripped up the rules of American politics, had spent three-plus years defying history and orthodoxy in a chaotic spectacle that dominated the national discourse and fervently engaged both sides of a bitterly divided country. And now, essentially for the first time, he was confronted by a crisis that was not of his own making.
    It was the kind of test presidents inevitably must face, and Trump responded with trademark certitude.
    “The virus will not have a chance against us,” Trump told Americans that night.
    Five months later, the coronavirus has killed more than 175,000 Americans and left tens of millions unemployed. And now, as Trump prepares to again accept the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday in a ceremony at the White House, he must convince an electorate that has largely disapproved of his handling of the pandemic that he is not to blame, deserves another term and that all the chaos has been worth it.
    “The future of our country and indeed our civilization is at stake on Nov. 3,” Trump said Friday.
    Trump has spent his presidency bending Washington to his will. He has transformed a public health crisis into a political litmus test. He has presided over a booming, if stratified, economy, and claimed he created it. He has again forced race to the center of the American conversation, using federal police to enforce his view. He has alienated historic allies and changed how much of the world views the United States.
    At seminal moments — in set speeches, impromptu riffs and long-sought policy reversals, examined in this story — he has redefined, at least temporarily, the presidency.
    But he has not shaken the virus.
    ___
    THE ADDRESS
    A virus born in China had swept through Europe and reached America’s shores. Global markets were tumbling, hospitals filling, cities locking down. On the day the coronavirus was officially declared a pandemic, beloved actor Tom Hanks announced he had tested positive. The NBA suspended its season. Story continues
    And for only the second time as president, Trump addressed the nation in a formal Oval Office speech. His spoke slowly, his voice halting, and he seemed unsure of what to do with his hands.
    The U.S., he told Americans, would “expeditiously defeat this virus.” But by any measure, Trump’s address didn’t go over well: The White House had to correct significant errors — one on travel from Europe, another on international cargo — within minutes of the speech’s conclusion.
    And ever since, the virus has proven impervious to bullying tweets or the ability to dictate cable news chyrons. It has upended American politics, stripping Trump of both his most potent reelection argument, a strong economy, and the venues from which to extol it, his raucous campaign rallies.
    “Historically, demagogic power wanes when seismic events overwhelm the existing moment,” said presidential historian Jon Meacham. “Pearl Harbor crushed America First; Bloody Sunday helped break the grip of Jim Crow. The pandemic may be the seismic shift, the mind-concentrating challenge, that ends Trump’s appeal beyond his hard-core base.”
    Until now, one of Trump’s greatest skills as a politician has been to assert his own political reality, careening from headline to headline, while seemingly able to dodge scandals that would likely have ended any other political career.
    His 2016 campaign was chaos and it worked, in part due to the unpopularity of Hillary Clinton, as well as outside help both foreign (Moscow) and domestic (James Comey). The Russia investigation shadowed him throughout his first two years in office. His response: an unrelenting assault from the Oval Office on the investigators and intelligence agencies.
    In the end, special counsel Robert Mueller did not find that Trump conspired with Moscow to interfere with the election, but he also did not exonerate the president on possible charges of obstruction of justice. Trump claimed total victory. Several key aides ended up with guilty pleas, yet the president emerged relatively unscathed — only soon to enter another maelstrom over foreign help, this time his request to Ukraine to investigate his eventual Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.
    Somehow, Trump’s block-the-sun response made the third impeachment of a sitting president feel like both a foregone conclusion and an afterthought.
    He had, again, survived. But the day after his acquittal also brought an ominous milestone: the nation’s first COVID-19 death.
    ___
    THE CRASH
    When Trump made the trip to the Capitol for his State of the Union address in February, he was buoyed by polling that showed the impeachment proceedings had turned out to have little impact and Americans approved of his handling of the economy.
    “Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again,” Trump declared.
    The numbers did look good. And Trump aides were quick to credit his sweeping tax cut, one of his signature first-term achievements.
    The unemployment rate was hovering at 3.5%, a level not seen since the 1960s. The stock market, one of the president’s favorite measures of economic success, was up roughly 20% from the previous year. And workers, particularly in lower-paying jobs, were seeing wages tick up.
    Trump’s campaign advisers were giddy over signs that his message was resonating beyond the voters who had helped him win 2016. Advisers took note of the significant number of people requesting tickets to Trump rallies who hadn’t voted in the last presidential election.
    Since 1956, in the 12 months before presidential elections, only one of nine incumbent presidents lost when unemployment fell over that year (Gerald Ford in 1976), and only one was reelected when it rose (Dwight Eisenhower in 1956).
    Then came the virus.
    In a matter of weeks, the economy collapsed. Unemployment skyrocketed to 14.7% and all the gains made by the stock market since he won reelection were erased.
    The virus-weakened economy has shown some signs of improvement but it is far from being healed. Unemployment has edged down to 10.2% — still just below the peak of U.S. joblessness in the Great Recession — and the S&P 500 reached a new high.
    But the suffering for a huge slice of America remains great. More than 40% of recent layoffs are likely to become permanent job losses, by one recent estimate. The National Restaurant Association forecasts the industry could lose 5 to 7 million employees. And if the White House and Congress don’t come to terms on another aid package, the economy could go sideways after Labor Day.
    Still, Trump’s backers believe he has an argument to make.
    “I think the message needs to be in post-COVID times: Trump has got the energy, the stamina, the experience and track record to bring us back,” said Dan Eberhart, chief executive of oil services company Canary LLC and a major Republican donor.
    But with less than 10 weeks to go until Election Day, Trump has spent an inordinate amount of time on squabbles and distractions, bashing the U.S. Postal Service, warning “suburban housewives” about perceived threats to their neighborhood idylls from affordable housing, lending credence to the right-wing QAnon conspiracy movement.
    “I don’t know what persuadable voter is moved by anti-Post Office rhetoric,” Eberhart said. “We’ve got to get the closing message right.”
    ___
    THE NEWS CONFERENCE
    Under a glistening ballroom chandelier, reporters packed into Trump’s Bedminster country club in New Jersey, waiting for the president to address shocking events that had unfolded more than 300 miles to the south on a sweltering day in August 2017.
    A clash in Charlottesville, Virginia, between white supremacists and anti-racism demonstrators had left a young woman dead, mowed down by a neo-Nazi who drove his car into a crowd of counter protesters. Trump’s response: There was hatred and bigotry on “many sides.” Days later, in a Trump Tower news conference, he again declined to denounce solely the white supremacists, speaking of “very fine people on both sides.”
    His equivocal words roiled the White House. Senior West Wing advisers threatened to quit. Republicans found their voices and condemned Trump.
    It was more than just a moment. Trump, a billionaire by some accounts, sold himself to voters as an unlikely champion of the forgotten man who would “Make America Great Again,” a slogan that was read by many as a callback to a simpler — and whiter — era in the United States.
    The president’s team showcased record low unemployment rates for African Americans and rising prosperity for minorities in the days before the pandemic. But his rhetoric and policies were viewed by many as offensive and, at times, racist.
    There was his campaign kickoff suggestion that many Mexican immigrants were “rapists.” His claim that an Indiana-born judge couldn’t be impartial because of his Latino heritage. And there was the racist lie of birtherism — Trump’s false suggestions that President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the U.S. and thus wasn’t eligible to be president.
    His moves to sharply curtail legal and illegal immigration became a frequent fault line for the administration. Thousands of Americans protested at airports in January 2017 when the White House enacted its first ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries, demonstrations that foreshadowed the uproar the following summer when the administration moved to forcibly separate migrant families at the southern border, leading to television images of weeping children pulled from their parents. And his closing — and ultimately failed — argument before the 2018 midterm elections was that dangerous caravans of migrants were headed for U.S. cities.
    “He has made explicit what has been fueling American politics since the 1960s. He is saying the quiet parts out loud,” said Eddie Glaude, chair of the department of African American studies at Princeton University. “He has made direct appeals to white grievance, to white resentment. He has dwelled in the underbelly of American politics.”
    Trump’s poll numbers, already wobbling, fell further in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer.
    As protests calling for racial justice erupted, Trump leaned in on his law-and-order cry, depicting demonstrators as “thugs.” References to Lafayette Square, the park across from the White House, now evoke images of Trump posing in front of a damaged church holding up a Bible after officers forcefully routed demonstrators from the area.
    ___
    THE SUMMIT
    Vladimir Putin smiled.
    The world was watching a post-summit news conference by the American and Russian leaders in Helsinki in July 2018, and Trump had just publicly sided with Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies on the question of election interference.
    The uproar was immediate. Even before Air Force One took off for Washington, Trump’s comments were condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike.
    Trump’s deference to Putin, beyond reviving questions about the American leader’s possible ties to Moscow, illuminated his own brand of foreign policy, one that has strained ties with Western allies, in favor of transactional relationships and a warmth toward strongmen.
    “Trump came into office believing that the cost of American world leadership was far greater than the benefits,” said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “He sees allies as economic competitors rather than strategic partners.”
    It all adds up to foreign policy wins, in the view of Trump supporters. After his prodding, more NATO members boosted spending on defense. The Islamic State, which once controlled 34,000 square miles in Syria and Iraq, has been defanged. And North Korea, which at the start of Trump’s term was widely regarded as the most volatile foreign policy issue on his plate, has remained relatively quiet.
    “We have two foreign policy presidents with Trump,” said James Carafano, national security expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “There is the showman Trump and there is the serious foreign policy Trump. We spend way too much time focusing on the showmanship.”
    Outside of Trump’s links to Putin, no relationship has attracted more scrutiny than the president’s hot-cold ties with China’s Xi Jinping.
    Trump campaigned as a China hawk but, after being feted on an extravagant state visit to Beijing, his tone softened and he was eager to strike a new trade deal. And when the virus began to ignite around Wuhan, the president was reluctant to endanger negotiations and thus slow to criticize China.
    Those days of expedient restraint are long gone, replaced by Trump’s determination to affix blame elsewhere for the pandemic that has imperiled his presidency. The coronavirus, in Trump’s telling, became the “China virus.”
    ___
    TRUTH AND CONSEQUENCE
    No one knew when Trump arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina, on March 3, that it might turn out to be the last jam-packed, big stadium rally of his presidency.
    At that point in the crisis — more than a week before the government recommended Americans sharply curtail activities to slow the spread of the virus — the number of U.S. infections had surpassed 100 and six people were confirmed dead. Trump assured the 9,600-person crowd that night he was leaning on the “greatest professionals in the world” to advise him.
    “My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and that’s what I’ll do,” declared Trump. He added, “America is so resilient, we know what we’re doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth.”
    Over the course of his presidency, Trump has leaned hard on florid overstatement, misdirection and out-right lies.
    It was a pattern set on his first full day in office when he ordered his press secretary to exaggerate the crowd size at his 2017 inauguration. Since then, he incorrectly claimed the Mueller report “totally exonerated” him, he insisted his administration was “taxing the hell out of China” even as the trade deficit grew, and he promised a sweeping health care plan that has yet to emerge.
    But his declaration at the Charlotte rally that he was getting advice from some of the greatest minds in medicine rang true. His coronavirus task force included Dr. Anthony Fauci, a renowned infectious disease expert, and Dr. Deborah Birx, who had worked with Fauci for years combating HIV/AIDS globally. Their presence gave the medical community hope that Trump would let the scientists lead him and the country through the crisis, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University.
    Trump, in both private life and in the West Wing, has always made himself the center of power, the structure likened to “a wheel where all the spokes lead to the center, directly to the president,” according to Chris Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax and a longtime friend of Trump.
    “There was no hierarchy at Trump Org and his White House mirrors that because, for Trump, it’s never been about organization, it is all about results,” said Ruddy.
    Reinforcing that, the Trump White House has seen an unprecedented amount of turnover among senior staff and Cabinet members, many of whom sharply criticized the president after leaving. And Trump soon began to break with the medical experts.
    “He won the benefit of the doubt in the public health community because he surrounded himself with the people who would follow the science,” Gostin said. “The problem is, it doesn’t matter if you have the right people around you if don’t listen them.”
    Trump, in defiance of federal guidelines, pushed for a rapid reopening of the economy even as public health experts warned him to go slow.
    He promoted the use of the drug hydroxychloroquine as a “game changer,” and even used it himself, despite federal warnings against taking the malaria drug to combat COVID-19. He regularly asserts that the virus will soon “go away.” And he recently dismissed a warning by the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, that the U.S. could be in for “the worst fall, from a public health perspective, we’ve ever had” if Americans don’t step up mitigation efforts, such as wearing masks.
    “I think that we’re doing very well,” Trump said. “We’re on our way.”
    That’s the bravado that Trump has projected throughout his presidency. He frequently proclaims that no president, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, has accomplished as much as he has.
    He’s moved the federal judicial system far to the right with the appointment of two conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court and more than 200 federal judges to lower courts. And he’s built more than 200 miles of his planned U.S.-Mexico wall, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign promise to slow illegal immigration.
    But in the end, Trump has often ended up his own worst enemy, unwilling or unable to check his impulses. The campaign he now faces is less a choice between candidates than a referendum on himself, a weighting he will try to reverse before November.
    And his most lasting legacy might be undermining Americans’ trust in institutions, said Brian Ott, who heads the communication department at Missouri State University and has done extensive research on the president’s social media rhetoric.
    “He has waged war on science, fact and truth,” Ott said. “He has, in short, debased the office he holds and the entire nation with his endless lying.”

    WASHINGTON (AP) — His face framed by the golden Oval Office curtains behind him, President Donald Trump stared straight into the camera aimed at the Resolute Desk.
    It was the night of March 11, 2020. And Trump’s presidency would be forever changed.
    Trump, whose improbable election ripped up the rules of American politics, had spent three-plus years defying history and orthodoxy in a chaotic spectacle that dominated the national discourse and fervently engaged both sides of a bitterly divided country. And now, essentially for the first time, he was confronted by a crisis that was not of his own making.
    It was the kind of test presidents inevitably must face, and Trump responded with trademark certitude.
    “The virus will not have a chance against us,” Trump told Americans that night.
    Five months later, the coronavirus has killed more than 175,000 Americans and left tens of millions unemployed. And now, as Trump prepares to again accept the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday in a ceremony at the White House, he must convince an electorate that has largely disapproved of his handling of the pandemic that he is not to blame, deserves another term and that all the chaos has been worth it.
    “The future of our country and indeed our civilization is at stake on Nov. 3,” Trump said Friday.
    Trump has spent his presidency bending Washington to his will. He has transformed a public health crisis into a political litmus test. He has presided over a booming, if stratified, economy, and claimed he created it. He has again forced race to the center of the American conversation, using federal police to enforce his view. He has alienated historical allies and changed how much of the world views the United States.
    At seminal moments — in set speeches, impromptu riffs and long-sought policy reversals, examined in this story — he has redefined, at least temporarily, the presidency.
    But he has not shaken the virus.
    ___
    THE ADDRESS
    A virus born in China had swept through Europe and reached America’s shores. Global markets were tumbling, hospitals filling, cities locking down. On the day the coronavirus was officially declared a pandemic, beloved actor Tom Hanks announced he had tested positive. The NBA suspended its season.
    And for only the second time as president, Trump addressed the nation in a formal Oval Office speech. He spoke slowly, his voice halting, and he seemed unsure of what to do with his hands.
    The U.S., he told Americans, would “expeditiously defeat this virus.” But by any measure, Trump’s address didn’t go over well: The White House had to correct significant errors — one on travel from Europe, another on international cargo — within minutes of the speech’s conclusion.
    And ever since, the virus has proven impervious to bullying tweets or the ability to dictate cable news chyrons. It has upended American politics, stripping Trump of both his most potent reelection argument, a strong economy, and the venues from which to extol it, his raucous campaign rallies.
    “Historically, demagogic power wanes when seismic events overwhelm the existing moment,” said presidential historian Jon Meacham. “Pearl Harbor crushed America First; Bloody Sunday helped break the grip of Jim Crow. The pandemic may be the seismic shift, the mind-concentrating challenge, that ends Trump’s appeal beyond his hard-core base.”
    Until now, one of Trump’s greatest skills as a politician has been to assert his own political reality, careening from headline to headline, while seemingly able to dodge scandals that would likely have ended any other political career.
    His 2016 campaign was chaos and it worked, in part due to the unpopularity of Hillary Clinton, as well as outside help both foreign (Moscow) and domestic (James Comey). The Russia investigation shadowed him throughout his first two years in office. His response: an unrelenting assault from the Oval Office on the investigators and intelligence agencies.
    In the end, special counsel Robert Mueller did not find that Trump conspired with Moscow to interfere with the election, but he also did not exonerate the president on possible charges of obstruction of justice. Trump claimed total victory. Several key aides ended up with guilty pleas, yet the president emerged relatively unscathed — only soon to enter another maelstrom over foreign help, this time his request to Ukraine to investigate his eventual Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.
    Somehow, Trump's block-the-sun response made the third impeachment of a sitting president feel like both a foregone conclusion and an afterthought.
    He had, again, survived. But the day after his acquittal also brought an ominous milestone: the nation’s first COVID-19 death.
    ___
    THE CRASH
    When Trump made the trip to the Capitol for his State of the Union address in February, he was buoyed by polling that showed the impeachment proceedings had turned out to have little impact and Americans approved of his handling of the economy.
    “Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again,” Trump declared.
    The numbers did look good. And Trump aides were quick to credit his sweeping tax cut, one of his signature first-term achievements.
    The unemployment rate was hovering at 3.5%, a level not seen since the 1960s. The stock market, one of the president’s favorite measures of economic success, was up roughly 20% from the previous year. And workers, particularly in lower-paying jobs, were seeing wages tick up.
    Trump’s campaign advisers were giddy over signs that his message was resonating beyond the voters who had helped him win 2016. Advisers took note of the significant number of people requesting tickets to Trump rallies who hadn’t voted in the last presidential election.
    Since 1956, in the 12 months before presidential elections, only one of nine incumbent presidents lost when unemployment fell over that year (Gerald Ford in 1976), and only one was reelected when it rose (Dwight Eisenhower in 1956).
    Then came the virus.
    In a matter of weeks, the economy collapsed. Unemployment skyrocketed to 14.7% and all the gains made by the stock market since he was elected were erased.
    The virus-weakened economy has shown some signs of improvement but it is far from being healed. Unemployment has edged down to 10.2% — still just below the peak of U.S. joblessness in the Great Recession — and the S&P 500 reached a new high.
    But the suffering for a huge slice of America remains great. More than 40% of recent layoffs are likely to become permanent job losses, by one recent estimate. The National Restaurant Association forecasts the industry could lose 5 to 7 million employees. And if the White House and Congress don’t come to terms on another aid package, the economy could go sideways after Labor Day.
    Still, Trump’s backers believe he has an argument to make.
    “I think the message needs to be in post-COVID times: Trump has got the energy, the stamina, the experience and track record to bring us back,” said Dan Eberhart, chief executive of oil services company Canary LLC and a major Republican donor.
    But with less than 10 weeks to go until Election Day, Trump has spent an inordinate amount of time on squabbles and distractions, bashing the U.S. Postal Service, warning “suburban housewives” about perceived threats to their neighborhood idylls from affordable housing, lending credence to the right-wing QAnon conspiracy movement.
    “I don’t know what persuadable voter is moved by anti-Post Office rhetoric,” Eberhart said. “We've got to get the closing message right.”
    ___
    THE NEWS CONFERENCE
    Under a glistening ballroom chandelier, reporters packed into Trump’s Bedminster country club in New Jersey, waiting for the president to address shocking events that had unfolded more than 300 miles to the south on a sweltering day in August 2017.
    A clash in Charlottesville, Virginia, between white supremacists and anti-racism demonstrators had left a young woman dead, mowed down by a neo-Nazi who drove his car into a crowd of counter protesters. Trump’s response: There was hatred and bigotry on “many sides.” Days later, in a Trump Tower news conference, he again declined to denounce solely the white supremacists, speaking of “very fine people on both sides.”
    His equivocal words roiled the White House. Senior West Wing advisers threatened to quit. Republicans found their voices and condemned Trump.
    It was more than just a moment. Trump, a billionaire by some accounts, sold himself to voters as an unlikely champion of the forgotten man who would “Make America Great Again,” a slogan that was read by many as a callback to a simpler — and whiter — era in the United States.
    The president’s team showcased record low unemployment rates for African Americans and rising prosperity for minorities in the days before the pandemic. But his rhetoric and policies were viewed by many as offensive and, at times, racist.
    There was his campaign kickoff suggestion that many Mexican immigrants were “rapists.” His claim that an Indiana-born judge couldn’t be impartial because of his Latino heritage. And there was the racist lie of birtherism — Trump’s false suggestions that President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the U.S. and thus wasn’t eligible to be president.
    His moves to sharply curtail legal and illegal immigration became a frequent fault line for the administration. Thousands of Americans protested at airports in January 2017 when the White House enacted its first ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries, demonstrations that foreshadowed the uproar the following summer when the administration moved to forcibly separate migrant families at the southern border, leading to television images of weeping children pulled from their parents. And his closing — and ultimately failed —argument before the 2018 midterm elections was that dangerous caravans of migrants were headed for U.S. cities.
    “He has made explicit what has been fueling American politics since the 1960s. He is saying the quiet parts out loud,” said Eddie Glaude, chair of the department of African American studies at Princeton University. “He has made direct appeals to white grievance, to white resentment. He has dwelled in the underbelly of American politics.”
    Trump’s poll numbers, already wobbling, fell further in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer.
    As protests calling for racial justice erupted, Trump leaned in on his law-and-order cry, depicting demonstrators as “thugs.” References to Lafayette Square, the park across from the White House, now evoke images of Trump posing in front of a damaged church holding up a Bible after officers forcefully routed demonstrators from the area.
    ___
    THE SUMMIT
    Vladimir Putin smiled.
    The world was watching a post-summit news conference by the American and Russian leaders in Helsinki in July 2018, and Trump had just publicly sided with Putin over his own intelligence agencies on the question of election interference.
    The uproar was immediate. Even before Air Force One took off for Washington, Trump’s comments were condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike.
    Trump’s deference to Putin, beyond reviving questions about the American leader’s possible ties to Moscow, illuminated his own brand of foreign policy, one that has strained ties with Western allies, in favor of transactional relationships and a warmth toward strongmen.
    “Trump came into office believing that the cost of American world leadership was far greater than the benefits,” said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “He sees allies as economic competitors rather than strategic partners.”
    It all adds up to foreign policy wins, in the view of Trump supporters. After his prodding, more NATO members boosted spending on defense. The Islamic State, which once controlled 34,000 square miles in Syria and Iraq, has been defanged. And North Korea, which at the start of Trump’s term was widely regarded as the most volatile foreign policy issue on his plate, has remained relatively quiet.
    “We have two foreign policy presidents with Trump,” said James Carafano, national security expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “There is the showman Trump and there is the serious foreign policy Trump. We spend way too much time focusing on the showmanship.”
    Outside of Trump’s links to Putin, no relationship has attracted more scrutiny than the president’s hot-cold ties with China’s Xi Jinping.
    Trump campaigned as a China hawk but, after being feted on an extravagant state visit to Beijing, his tone softened and he was eager to strike a new trade deal. And when the virus began to ignite around Wuhan, the president was reluctant to endanger negotiations and thus slow to criticize China.
    Those days of expedient restraint are long gone, replaced by Trump’s determination to affix blame elsewhere for the pandemic that has imperiled his presidency. The coronavirus, in Trump’s telling, became the “China virus.”
    ___
    TRUTH AND CONSEQUENCE
    No one knew when Trump arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina, on March 2, that it might turn out to be the last jam-packed, big stadium rally of his presidency.
    At that point in the crisis — more than a week before the government recommended Americans sharply curtail activities to slow the spread of the virus — the number of U.S. infections had surpassed 100 and six people were confirmed dead. Trump assured the 9,600-person crowd that night he was leaning on the “greatest professionals in the world” to advise him.
    “My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and that’s what I’ll do,” declared Trump. He added, “America is so resilient, we know what we’re doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth.”
    Over the course of his presidency, Trump has leaned hard on florid overstatement, misdirection and out-right lies.
    It was a pattern set on his first full day in office when he ordered his press secretary to exaggerate the crowd size at his 2017 inauguration. Since then, he incorrectly claimed the Mueller report “totally exonerated” him, he insisted his administration was “taxing the hell out of China” even as the trade deficit grew, and he promised a sweeping health care plan that has yet to emerge.
    But his declaration at the Charlotte rally that he was getting advice from some of the greatest minds in medicine rang true. His coronavirus task force included Dr. Anthony Fauci, a renowned infectious disease expert, and Dr. Deborah Birx, who had worked with Fauci for years combating HIV/AIDS globally. Their presence gave the medical community hope that Trump would let the scientists lead him and the country through the crisis, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University.
    Trump, in both private life and in the West Wing, has always made himself the center of power, the structure likened to “a wheel where all the spokes lead to the center, directly to the president," according to Chris Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax and a longtime friend of Trump.
    “There was no hierarchy at Trump Org and his White House mirrors that because, for Trump, it’s never been about organization, it is all about results," said Ruddy.
    Reinforcing that, the Trump White House has seen an unprecedented amount of turnover among senior staff and Cabinet members, many of whom sharply criticized the president after leaving. And Trump soon began to break with the medical experts.
    “He won the benefit of the doubt in the public health community because he surrounded himself with the people who would follow the science,” Gostin said. “The problem is, it doesn’t matter if you have the right people around you if you don’t listen to them.”
    Trump, in defiance of federal guidelines, pushed for a rapid reopening of the economy even as public health experts warned him to go slow.
    He promoted the use of the drug hydroxychloroquine as a “game changer,” and even used it himself, despite federal warnings against taking the malaria drug to combat COVID-19. He regularly asserts that the virus will soon “go away.” And he recently dismissed a warning by the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, that the U.S. could be in for “the worst fall, from a public health perspective, we’ve ever had” if Americans don’t step up mitigation efforts, such as wearing masks.
    “I think that we’re doing very well,” Trump said. “We’re on our way.”
    That’s the bravado that Trump has projected throughout his presidency. He frequently proclaims that no president, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, has accomplished as much as he has.
    He’s moved the federal judicial system far to the right with the appointment of two conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court and more than 200 federal judges to lower courts. And he’s built more than 200 miles of his planned U.S.-Mexico wall, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign promise to slow illegal immigration.
    But in the end, Trump has often ended up his own worst enemy, unwilling or unable to check his impulses. The campaign he now faces is less a choice between candidates than a referendum on himself, a weighting he will try to reverse before November.
    And his most lasting legacy might be undermining Americans’ trust in institutions, said Brian Ott, who heads the communication department at Missouri State University and has done extensive research on the president’s social media rhetoric.
    “He has waged war on science, fact and truth,” Ott said. “He has, in short, debased the office he holds and the entire nation with his endless lying.”

    It usually makes sense to follow the money when seeking understanding of almost any major change. The strategy of following the money in our current convergence of crises in late summer of 2020 leads us directly to the lockdowns. The lockdowns were first imposed on people in the Wuhan area of China. Then other populations throughout the world were told to “shelter in place,” all in the name of combating the COVID-19 virus.
    Understanding of the enormous impact of the lockdowns is still developing. The lockdowns are proving to pack a far more devastating punch than any other aspect of the strange sequence of events that is making 2020 a year like no other. Even when the issues are narrowed to those of human health, the lockdowns have had, and will continue to have, far more wide-ranging and devastating impacts than the celebrity virus.
    The lockdowns have, for starters, been directly responsible for explosive rates of suicide, domestic violence, overdoses, and depression. In the long run, these maladies from the lockdowns will probably kill and harm many more people than COVID-19.
    But this comparison does not tell the full story. The nature and length of the lockdowns are causing millions of people to lose their jobs, businesses and financial viability. It seems that the economic descent is still gathering force. The assault of the lockdowns on our economic wellbeing still has much farther to go.
    The lockdowns have proven to be a powerful instrument of social control. This attribute is becoming very attractive especially to some politicians. They have discovered they can derive considerable political traction from hyping and exploiting the largely manufactured pandemic panic.
    The lockdowns are still a work-in-progress. There are past lockdowns, revolving lockdowns, partial lockdowns, mandatory lockdowns, voluntary lockdowns, severe lockdowns and probably an array of many lockdown types yet to be invented.
    The lockdowns extend to disruptions in supply chains, disruptions in money flows, drops in consumption, breakdowns in transport and travelling, increased bankruptcies, losses of finance leading to losses of housing, as well as the inability to pay taxes and debts.
    The lockdowns extend beyond personal habitations to prohibitions on large assemblies of people in stadiums, concert halls, churches, and a myriad of places devoted to public recreation and entertainment. On the basis of this way of looking at what is happening, it becomes clear the economic and health effects of the lockdowns are far more pronounced than the damage wrought directly by the new coronavirus.
    This approach to following the money leads to the question of whether the spread of COVID-19 was set in motion as a pretext. Was COVID-19 unleashed as an expedient for bringing about the lockdowns with the goal of crashing the existing economy? What rationale could there possibly be for purposely crashing the existing economy?
    One possible reason might have been to put in place new structures to create the framework for a new set of economic relationships. With these changes would come accompanying sets of altered social and political relationships.
    Among the economic changes being sought are the robotization of almost everything, cashless financial interactions, and elaborate AI impositions. These AI impositions extend to digital alterations of human consciousness and behavior. The emphasis being placed on vaccines is very much interwoven with plans to extend AI into an altered matrix of human nanobiotechnology.
    There are other possibilities to consider. One is that in the autumn of 2019 the economy was already starting to falter. Fortuitously for some, the new virus came along at a moment when it could be exploited as a scapegoat. By placing responsibility for the economic debacle on pathogens rather than people, Wall Street bankers and federal authorities are let off the hook. They can escape any accounting for an economic calamity that they had a hand in helping to instigate.
    A presentation in August of 2019 by the Wall Street leviathan, BlackRock Financial Management, provides a telling indicator of foreknowledge. It was well understood by many insiders in 2019 that a sharp economic downturn was imminent.
    At a meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole Wyoming, BlackRock representatives delivered a strategy for dealing with the future downturn. Several months later during the spring of 2020 this strategy was adopted by both the US Treasury and the US Federal Reserve. BlackRock’s plan from August of 2019 set the basis of the federal response to the much-anticipated economic meltdown.
    Much of this essay is devoted to considering the background of the controversial agencies now responding to the economic devastation created by the lockdowns. One of these agencies is empowered to bring into existence large quantities of debt-laden money.
    The very public role in 2020 of the Federal Reserve of the United States resuscitates many old grievances. When the Federal Reserve was first created in 1913 it was heavily criticized as a giveaway of federal authority.
    The critics lamented the giveaway to private bankers whose firms acquired ownership of all twelve of the regional banks that together constitute the Federal Reserve. Of these twelve regional banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is by far the largest and most dominant especially right now.
    The Federal Reserve of the United States combined forces with dozens of other privately-owned central banks thoughout the world to form the Bank of International Settlements. Many of the key archetypes for this type of banking were developed in Europe and the City of London where the Rothschild banking family had a large and resilient role, one that persists until this day.
    Along with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock was deeply involved in helping to administer the bailout in 2008. This bailout resuscitated many failing Wall Street firms together with their counterparties in a number of speculative ventures involving various forms of derivatives.
    The bailouts resulted in payments of $29 trillion, much of it going to restore failing financial institutions whose excesses actually caused the giant economic crash. Where the financial sector profited greatly from the bailouts, taxpayers were abused yet again. The burden of an expanded national debt fell ultimately on taxpayers who must pay the interest on the loans for the federal bailout of the “too big to fail” financial institutions.
    Unsettling precedents are set by the Wall Street club’s manipulation of the economic crash of 2007-2010 to enrich its own members so extravagantly. This prior experience bodes poorly for the intervention by the same players in this current round of responses to the economic crisis of 2020.
    In preparing this essay I have enjoyed the many articles by Pam Martens and Russ Martens in Wall Street on Parade . These hundreds of well-researched articles form a significant primary source on the recent history of the Federal Reserve, including over the last few months.
    In this essay I draw a contrast between the privately-owned regional banks of the Federal Reserve and the government-owned Bank of Canada that once issued low-interest loans to build infrastructure projects.
    With this arrangement in place, Canada went through a major period of national growth between 1938 and 1974. Canada emerged from this period with a national debt of only $20 billion. Then in 1974 Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau dropped this arrangement to enable Canada to join the Bank of International Settlements. One result is that national debt rose to $700 billion by 2020.
    We need to face the current financial crisis by developing new institutions that avoid the pitfalls of old remedies for old problems that no longer prevail. We need to make special efforts to change our approach to the problem of excessive debts and the overconcentration of wealth in fewer and fewer hands.
    Locking Down the Viability of Commerce
    Of all the facets of the ongoing fiasco generally associated with the coronavirus crisis, none has been so widely catastrophic as the so-called “lockdowns.” The supposed cure of the lockdowns is itself proving to be much more lethal and debilitating than COVID-19’s flu-like impact on human health.
    Many questions arise from the immense economic consequences attributed to the initial effort to “flatten the curve” of the hospital treatments for COVID-19. Did the financial crisis occur as a result of the spread of the new coronavirus crisis? Or was the COVID-19 crisis set in motion to help give cover to a long-building economic meltdown that was already well underway in the autumn of 2019?
    The lockdowns were first instituted in Wuhan China with the objective of slowing down the spread of the virus so that hospitals would not be overwhelmed. Were the Chinese lockdowns engineered in part to create a model to be followed in Europe, North America, Indochina and other sites of infection like India and Australia? The Chinese lockdowns in Hubei province and then in other parts of China apparently set an example influencing the decision of governments in many jurisdictions. Was this Chinese example for the rest of the world created by design to influence the nature of international responses?
    The lockdowns represented a new form of response to a public health crisis. Quarantines have long been used as a means of safeguarding the public from the spread of contagious maladies. Quarantines, however, involve isolating the sick to protect the well. On the other hand the lockdowns are directed at limiting the movement and circulation of almost everyone whether or not they show symptoms of any infections.
    Hence lockdowns, or, more euphemistically “sheltering in place,” led to the cancellation of many activities and to the shutdown of institutions. The results extended, for instance, to the closure of schools, sports events, theatrical presentations and business operations. In this way the lockdowns also led to the crippling of many forms of economic interaction. National economies as well as international trade and commerce were severely impacted.
    The concept of lockdowns was not universally embraced and applied. For instance, the governments of Sweden and South Korea did not accept the emerging orthodoxy about enforcing compliance with all kinds of restrictions on human interactions. Alternatively, the government of Israel was an early and strident enforcer of very severe lockdown policies.
    At first it seemed the lockdown succeeded magnificently in saving Israeli lives. According to Israel Shamir , in other European states the Israeli model was often brought up as an example. In due course, however, the full extent of the assault on the viability of the Israeli economy began to come into focus. Then popular resistance was aroused to reject government attempts to enforce a second wave of lockdowns against a second wave of supposed infections. As Shamir sees it, the result is that “Today Israel is a failed state with a ruined economy and unhappy citizens.”
    In many countries the lockdowns began with a few crucial decisions made at the highest level of government. Large and proliferating consequences would flow from the initial determination of what activities, businesses, organizations, institutions and workers were to be designated as “essential.”
    The consequences would be severe for those individuals and businesses excluded from the designation identifying what is essential. This deep intervention into the realm of free choice in market relations set a major precedent for much more intervention of a similar nature to come.
    The arbitrary division of activities into essential and nonessential categories created a template to be frequently replicated and revised in the name of serving public heath. Suddenly central planning took a great leap forward. The momentum from a generation of neoliberalism was checked even as the antagonistic polarities between rich and poor continued to grow.
    To be defined as “nonessential” would soon be equated with job losses and business failures across many fields of enterprise as the first wave of lockdowns outside China unfolded. Indeed, it becomes clearer every day that revolving lockdowns, restrictions and social distancing are being managed in order to help give false justification to a speciously idealized vaccine fix as the only conclusive solution to a manufactured problem.
    What must it have meant for breadwinners who fed themselves and their families through wages or self-employment to be declared by government to be “non-essential”? Surely for real providers their jobs, their businesses and their earnings were essential for themselves and their dependents. All jobs and all businesses that people depend on for livelihoods, sustenance and survival are essential in their own way.
    Was COVID-19 a Cover for an Anticipated or Planned Financial Crisis?
    A major sign of financial distress in the US economy kicked in in mid-September of 2019 when there was a breakdown in the normal operation of the Repo Market. This repurchase market in the United States is important in maintaining liquidity in the financial system.
    Those directing entities like large banks, Wall Street traders and hedge funds frequently seek large amounts of cash on a short-term basis. They obtain this cash from, for instance, money market funds by putting up securities, often Treasury Bills, as collateral. Most often the financial instruments go back, say the following night, to their original owners with interest payments attached for the use of the cash.
    In mid-September the trust broke down between participants in the Repo Market. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York then entered the picture making trillions of dollars available to keep the system for short-term moving of assets going. This intervention repeated the operation that came in response to the first signs of trouble as Wall Street moved towards the stock market crash of 2008.
    One of the major problems on the eve of the bailout of 2008-09, like the problem in the autumn of 2019, had to do with the overwhelming of the real economy by massive speculative activity. The problem then, like a big part of the problem now, involves the disproportionate size of the derivative bets. The making of these bets have become a dangerous addiction that continues to this day to menace the viability of the financial system headquartered on Wall Street.
    By March of 2020 it was reported that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had turned on its money spigot to create $9 trillion in new money with the goal of keeping the failing Repo Market operational. The precise destinations of that money together with the terms of its disbursement, however, remain a secret. As Pam Martens and Russ Martens write ,
    Since the Fed turned on its latest money spigot to Wall Street [in September of 2019], it has refused to provide the public with the dollar amounts going to any specific banks. This has denied the public the ability to know which financial institutions are in trouble. The Fed, exactly as it did in 2008, has drawn a dark curtain around troubled banks and the public’s right to know, while aiding and abetting a financial coverup of just how bad things are on Wall Street.
    Looking back at the prior bailout from their temporal vantage point in January of 2020, the authors noted “During the 2007 to 2010 financial collapse on Wall Street – the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the Fed funnelled a total of $29 trillion in cumulative loans to Wall Street banks, their trading houses and their foreign derivative counterparties.”
    The authors compared the rate of the transfer of funds from the New York Federal Reserve Bank to the Wall Street banking establishment in the 2008 crash and in the early stages of the 2020 financial debacle. The authors observed , “at this rate, [the Fed] is going to top the rate of money it threw at the 2008 crisis in no time at all.”
    The view that all was well with the economy until the impact of the health crisis began to be felt in early 2020 leads away from the fact that money markets began to falter dangerously in the autumn of 2019. The problems with the Repo Market were part of a litany of indicators pointing to turbulence ahead in troubled economic waters.
    For instance, the resignation in 2019 of about 1,500 prominent corporate CEOs can be seen as a suggestion that news was circulating prior to 2020 about the imminence of serious financial problems ahead. Insiders’ awareness of menacing developments threatening the workings of the global economy were probably a factor in the decision of a large number of senior executives to exit the upper echelons of the business world.
    Not only did a record number of CEOs resign, but many of them sold off the bulk of their shares in the companies they were leaving.
    Pam Marten and Russ Marten who follow Wall Street’s machinations on a daily basis have advanced the case that the Federal Reserve is engaged in fraud by trying to make it seem that “the banking industry came into 2020 in a healthy condition;” that it is only because of “the COVID-19 pandemic” that the financial system is” unravelling,”
    The authors argue that this misrepresentation was deployed because the deceivers are apparently “desperate” to prevent Congress from conducting an investigation for the second time in twelve years on why the Fed, “had to engage in trillions of dollars of Wall Street bailouts.” In spite of the Fed’s fear of facing a Congressional investigation after the November 2020 vote, such a timely investigation of the US financial sector would well serve the public interest.
    The authors present a number of signs demonstrating that “the Fed knew, or should have known…. that there was a big banking crisis brewing in August of last year. [2019]” The signs of the financial crisis in the making included negative yields on government bonds around the world as well as big drops in the Dow Jones average. The plunge in the price of stocks was led by US banks, but especially Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase.
    Another significant indicator that something was deeply wrong in financial markets was a telling inversion in the value of Treasury notes with the two-year rate yielding more than the ten-year rate.
    Yet another sign of serious trouble ahead involved repeated contractions in the size of the German economy. Moreover, in September of 2019 news broke that officials of JP Morgan Chase faced criminal charges for RICO-style racketeering. This scandal added to the evidence of converging problems plaguing core economic institutions as more disruptive mayhem gathered on the horizons.
    Accordingly, there is ample cause to ask if there are major underlying reasons for the financial crash of 2020 other than the misnamed pandemic and the lockdowns done in its name of “flattening” its spikes of infection. At the same time, there is ample cause to recognize that the lockdowns have been a very significant factor in the depth of the economic debacle that is making 2020 a year like no other.
    Some go further. They argue that the financial crash of 2020 was not only anticipated but planned and pushed forward with clear understanding of its instrumental role in the Great Reset sought by self-appointed protagonists of creative destruction. The advocates of this interpretation place significant weight on the importance of the lockdowns as an effective means of obliterating in a single act a host of old economic relationships. For instance Peter Koenig examines the “farce and diabolical agenda of a universal lockdown.”
    Koenig writes , “The pandemic was needed as a pretext to halt and collapse the world economy and the underlying social fabric.”
    Inflating the Numbers and Traumatizing the Public to Energize the Epidemic of Fear
    There have been many pandemics in global history whose effects on human health have been much more pervasive and devastating than the current one said to be generated by a new coronavirus. In spite, however, of its comparatively mild flu-like effects on human health, at least at this point in the summer of 2020, there has never been a contagion whose spread has generated so much global publicity and hype. As in the aftermath of 9/11, this hype extends to audacious levels of media-generated panic. As with the psyop of 9/11, the media-induced panic has been expertly finessed by practitioners skilled in leveraging the currency of fear to realize a host of radical political objectives.
    According to Robert E. Wright in an essay published by the American Institute for Economic Research , “closing down the U.S. economy in response to COVID-19 was probably the worst public policy in at least one-hundred years.” As Wright sees it, the decision to lock down the economy was made in ignorant disregard of the deep and devastating impact that such an action would spur. “Economic lockdowns were the fantasies of government officials so out of touch with economic and physical reality that they thought the costs would be fairly low.”
    The consequences, Wright predicts , will extend across many domains including the violence done to the rule of law. The lockdowns, he writes, “turned the Constitution into a frail and worthless fabric.” Writing in late April, Wright touched on the comparisons to be made between the economic lockdowns and slavery. He write, “Slaves definitely had it worse than Americans under lockdown do, but already Americans are beginning to protest their confinement and to subtly subvert authorities, just as chattel slaves did.”
    The people held captive in confined lockdown settings have had the time and often the inclination to imbibe much of the 24/7 media coverage of the misnamed pandemic. Taken together, all this media sensationalism has come to constitute one of the most concerted psychological operations ever.
    The implications have been enormous for the mental health of multitudes of people. This massive alteration of attitudes and behaviours is the outcome of media experiments performed on human subjects without their informed consent. The media’s success in bringing about herd subservience to propagandistic messaging represents a huge incentive for more of the same to come. It turns out that the subject matter of public health offers virtually limitless potential for power-seeking interests and agents to meddle with the privacies, civil liberties and human rights of those they seek to manipulate, control and exploit.
    The social, economic and health impacts of the dislocations flowing from the lockdowns are proving to be especially devastating on the poorest, the most deprived and the most vulnerable members of society. This impact will continue to be marked in many ways, including in increased rates of suicide, domestic violence, mental illness, addictions, homelessness, and incarceration far larger than those caused directly by COVID-19. As rates of deprivation through poverty escalate, so too will crime rates soar.
    The over-the-top alarmism of the big media cabals has been well financed by the advertising revenue of the pharmaceutical industry. With some few exceptions, major media outlets pushed the public to accept the lockdowns as well as the attending losses in jobs and business activity. In seeking to push the agenda of their sponsors, the big media cartels have been especially unmindful of their journalistic responsibilities. Their tendency has been to avoid or censor forums where even expert practitioners of public health can publicly question and discuss government dictates about vital issues of public policy.
    Whether in Germany or the United States or many other countries, front line workers in this health care crisis have nevertheless gathered together with the goal of trying to correct the one-sided prejudices of of discriminatory media coverage. One of the major themes in the presentations by medical practitioners is to confront the chorus of media misrepresentations on the remedial effects of hydroxychloroquine and zinc.
    On July 27 a group of doctors gathered on the grounds of the US Supreme Court to try to address the biases of the media and the blind spots of government.
    Another aspect in the collateral damage engendered by COVID-19 alarmism is marked in the fatalities arising from the wholesale postponement of many necessary interventions including surgery. How many have died or will die because of the hold put on medical interventions to remedy cancer, heart conditions and many other potentially lethal ailments?
    Did the unprecedented lockdowns come about as part of a preconceived plan to inflate the severity of an anticipated financial meltdown? What is to be made of the suspicious intervention of administrators to produce severely padded numbers of reported deaths in almost every jurisdiction? This kind of manipulation of statistics raised the possibility that we are witnessing a purposeful and systemic inflation of the severity of this health care crisis.
    Questions about the number of cases arise because of the means of testing for the presence of a supposedly new coronavirus. The PCR system that is presently being widely used does not test for the virus but tests for the existence of antibodies produced in response to many health challenges including the common cold. This problem creates a good deal of uncertainty of what a positive test really means.
    The problems with calculating case numbers extend to widespread reports that have described people who were not tested for COVID-19 but who nevertheless received notices from officials counting them as COVID-19 positive. Broadcaster Armstrong Williams addressed the phenomenon on his network of MSM media outlets in late July.
    From the mass of responses he received, Williams estimated that those not tested but counted as a positive probably extends probably to hundreds of thousands of individuals. What would drive the effort to exaggerate the size of the afflicted population?
    This same pattern of inflation of case numbers was reinforced by the Tricare branch of the US Defense Department’s Military Health System. This branch sent out notices to 600,000 individuals who had not been tested. The notices nevertheless informed the recipients that they had tested positive for COVID 19.
    Is the inflation of COVID-19 death rates and cases numbers an expression of the zeal to justify the massive lockdowns? Were the lockdowns in China conceived as part of a scheme to help create the conditions for the public’s acceptance of a plan to remake the world’s political economy? What is to be made of the fact that those most identified with the World Economic Forum (WEF) have led the way in putting a positive spin on the reset arising from the very health crisis the WEF helped introduce and publicize in Oct. of 2019?
    As Usual, the Poor Get Poorer
    The original Chinese lockdowns in the winter of 2020 caused the breakdowns of import-export supply chains extending across the planet. Lockdowns in the movement of raw materials, parts, finished products, expertise, money and more shut down domestic businesses in China as well as transnational commerce in many countries outside China. The supply chain disruptions were especially severe for businesses that have dispensed with the practice of keeping on hand large inventories of parts and raw material, depending instead on just-in-time deliveries.
    As the supply chains broke down domestically and internationally, many enterprises lacked the revenue to pay their expenses. Bankruptcies began to proliferate at rates that will probably continue to be astronomical for some time. All kinds of loans and liabilities were not paid out in full or at all. Many homes are being re-mortgaged or cast into real estate markets as happened during the prelude and course of the bailouts of 2007-2010.
    The brunt of the financial onslaught hit small businesses especially hard. Collectively small businesses have been a big creator of jobs. They have picked up some of the slack from the rush of big businesses to downsize their number of full-time employees. Moreover, small businesses and start-ups are often the site of exceptionally agile innovations across broad spectrums of economic activity. The hard financial slam on the small business sector, therefore, is packing a heavy punch on the economic conditions of everyone.
    The devastating impact of the economic meltdown on workers and small businesses in Europe and North America extends in especially lethal ways to the massive population of poor people living all over the world. Many of these poor people reside in countries where much of the paid work is irregular and informal.
    At the end of April the International Labor Organization (ILO), an entity created along with the League of Nations at the end of the First World War, that there would be 1.6 billion victims of the meltdown in the worldwide “informal economy.” In the first month of the crisis these workers based largely in Africa and Latin America lost 60% of their subsistence level incomes.
    As ILO Director-General, Guy Ryder, has asserted ,
    This pandemic has laid bare in the cruellest way, the extraordinary precariousness and injustices of our world of work. It is the decimation of livelihoods in the informal economy – where six out of ten workers make a living – which has ignited the warnings from our colleagues in the World Food Programme, of the coming pandemic of hunger. It is the gaping holes in the social protection systems of even the richest countries, which have left millions in situations of deprivation. It is the failure to guarantee workplace safety that condemns nearly 3 million to die each year because of the work they do. And it is the unchecked dynamic of growing inequality which means that if, in medical terms, the virus does not discriminate between its victims in its social and economic impact, it discriminates brutally against the poorest and the powerless.
    Guy Ryder remembered the optimistic rhetoric in officialdom’s responses to the economic crash of 2007-2009. He compares the expectations currently being aroused by the vaccination fixation with the many optimistic sentiments previously suggesting the imminence of remedies for grotesque levels of global inequality. Ryder reflected,
    We’ve heard it before. The mantra which provided the mood music of the crash of 2008-2009 was that once the vaccine to the virus of financial excess had been developed and applied, the global economy would be safer, fairer, more sustainable. But that didn’t happen. The old normal was restored with a vengeance and those on the lower echelons of labour markets found themselves even further behind.
    The internationalization of increased unemployment and poverty brought about in the name of combating the corona crisis is having the effect of further widening the polarization between rich and poor on a global scale. Ryder’s metaphor about the false promises concerning a “vaccine” to correct “financial excess” can well be seen as a precautionary comment on the flowery rhetoric currently adorning the calls for a global reset.
    Wall Street and 9/11
    The world economic crisis of 2020 is creating the context for large-scale repeats of some key aspects of the bailout of 2007-2010. The bailout of 2007-2008 drew, in turn, from many practices developed in the period when the explosive events of 9/11 triggered a worldwide reset of global geopolitics.
    While the events of 2008 and 2020 both drew attention to the geopolitical importance of Wall Street, the terrible pummelling of New York’s financial district was the event that ushered in a new era of history, an era that has delivered us to the current financial meltdown/lockdown.
    It lies well beyond the scope of this essay to go into detail about the dynamics of what really transpired on 9/11. Nevertheless, some explicit reckoning with this topic is crucial to understanding some of the essential themes addressed in this essay.
    Indeed, it would be difficult to overstate the relevance of 9/11 to the background and nature of the current debacle. The execution and spinning of 9/11 were instrumental in creating the repertoire of political trickery presently being adapted in the manufacturing and exploiting of the COVID-19 hysteria. A consistent attribute of the journey from 9/11 to COVID-19 has been the amplification of executive authority through the medium of emergency measures enactments, policies and dictates.
    Wall Street is a major site where much of this political trickery was concocted in planning exercises extending to many other sites of power and intrigue. In the case of 9/11, a number of prominent Wall Street firms were involved before, during and after the events of September 11 . As is extremely well documented, these events have been misrepresented in ways that helped to further harness the military might of the United States to the expansionistic designs of Israel in the Middle East.
    The response of the Federal Reserve to the events of 9/11 helped set in motion a basic approach to disaster management that continues to this day. Almost immediately following the pulverization of Manhattan’s most gigantic and iconographic landmarks, Federal Reserve officials made it their highest priority to inject liquidity into financial markets. Many different kinds of scenario can be advanced behind the cover of infusing liquidity into markets.
    For three days in a row the Federal Reserve Bank of New York turned on its money spigots to inject transfusions of $100 billion dollars of newly generated funds into the Wall Street home of the financial system. The declared aim was to keep the flow of capital between financial institutions well lubricated. The Federal Reserve’s infusions of new money into Wall Street took many forms. New habits and appetites were thereby cultivated in ways that continue to influence the behaviour of Wall Street organizations in the financial debacle of 2020.
    The revelations concerning the events of 9/11 contained a number of financial surprises. Questions immediately arose, for instance, about whether the destruction of the three World Trade Center skyscrapers had obliterated software and hardware vital to the continuing operations of computerized banking systems. Whatever problems arose along these lines, it turned out that there was sufficient digital information backed up in other locations to keep banking operations viable.
    But while much digital data survived the destruction of core installations in the US financial sector, some strategic information was indeed obliterated. For instance, strategic records entailed in federal investigations into many business scandals were lost. Some of the incinerated data touched on, for instance, the machinations of the energy giant, Enron , along with its Wall Street partners, JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup.
    The writings of E. P Heidner are prominent in the literature posing theories about the elimination of incriminating documentation as a result of the controlled demolitions of 9/11 . What information was eliminated and what was retained in the wake of the devastation? Heidner has published a very ambitious account placing the events of 9/11 at the forefront of a deep and elaborate relationship linking George H. W. Bush to Canada’s Barrick Gold and the emergence of gold derivatives.
    The surprises involving 9/11 and Wall Street included evidence concerning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. A few individuals enriched themselves significantly by purchasing a disproportionately high number of put options on shares about to fall precipitously as a result of the anticipated events of 9/11. Investigators, however, chose to ignore this evidence because it did not conform to the prevailing interpretation of who did what to whom on 9/11.
    Another suspicious group of transactions conducted right before 9/11 involved some very large purchases of five-year US Treasury notes. These instruments are well known hedges when one has knowledge that a world crisis is imminent. One of these purchases was a $5 billion transaction. The US Treasury Department would have been informed about the identity of the purchaser. Nevertheless the FBI and the Securities Exchange Commission collaborated to point public attention away from these suspect transactions. (p. 199)
    On the very day of 9/11 local police arrested Israeli suspects employed in the New York area as Urban Movers. The local investigators were soon pressured to ignore the evidence, however, and go along with the agenda of the White House and the media chorus during the autumn of 2001.
    In the hours following the pulverization of the Twin Towers the dominant mantra was raised “Osama bin Laden and al-Qeada did it.” That mantra led in the weeks, months and years that followed to US-led invasions of several Muslim-majority countries. Some have described these military campaigns as wars for Israel .
    Soon New York area jails were being filled up with random Muslims picked up for nothing more than visa violations and such. The unrelenting demonization of Muslims collectively can now be seen in retrospect as a dramatic psychological operation meant to poison minds as the pounding of the war drums grew in intensity. In the process a traumatized public were introduced to concepts like “jihad.” At no time has there ever been a credible police investigation into the question of who is responsible for the 9/11 crimes .
    Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld chose September 10, the day before 9/11, to break the news at a press conference that $2.3 trillion had gone missing from the Pentagon’s budget. Not surprisingly the story of the missing money got buried the next day as reports of the debacle in Manhattan and Washington DC dominated MSM news coverage.
    As reported by Forbes Magazine , the size of the amount said to have gone missing in Donald Rumsfeld’s 2001 report of Defense Department spending had mushroomed by 2015 to around $21 trillion. It was Mark Skidmore, an Economics Professor at the University of Michigan, who became the main sleuth responsible for identifying the gargantuan amount of federal funds that the US government can’t account for.
    As the agency that created the missing tens of trillions that apparently has disappeared without a trace, wouldn’t the US Federal Reserve be in a position to render some assistance in tracking down the lost funds? Or is the Federal Reserve somehow a participant or a complicit party in the disappearance of the tens of trillions without a paper trail?
    The inability or unwillingness of officialdom to explain what happened to the lost $21 trillion, an amount comparable to the size of the entire US national debt prior to the lockdowns, might be viewed in the light of the black budgets of the US Department of Defense (DOD). Black budgets are off-the-books funds devoted to secret research and to secret initiatives in applied research.
    In explaining this phenomenon, former Canadian Defense Minister, Paul Hellyer, has observed , “thousands of billions of dollars have been spent on projects about which Congress and the Commander In Chief have deliberately been kept in the dark.” Eric Zuess goes further. As he explains it, the entire Defense Department operates pretty much on the basis of an unusual system well outside the standard rules of accounting applied in other federal agencies.
    When news broke about the missing $21 trillion, federal authorities responded by promising that special audits would be conducted to explain the irregularities. The results of those audits, if they took place at all, were never published. The fact that the Defense of Department has developed in a kind of audit free zone has made it a natural magnet for people and interests engaged in all kinds of criminal activities.
    Eric Zuess calls attention to the 1,000 military bases around the world that form a natural network conducive to the cultivation of many forms of criminal trafficking. Zuess includes in his reflections commentary on the secret installations in some American embassies but especially in the giant US Embassy in Baghdad Iraq.
    The US complex in Baghdad’s Green Zone is the biggest Embassy in the world. Its monumental form on a 104 acre site expresses the expansionary dynamics of US military intervention in the Middle East and Eurasia following 9/11.
    The phenomenon of missing tens of trillions calls attention to larger patterns of kleptocratic activity that forms a major subject addressed here. The shifts into new forms of organized crime in the name of “national security” began to come to light in the late 1980s. An important source of disclosures was the series of revelations that accompanied the coming apart of the Saudi-backed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the BCCI.
    The nature of this financial institution, where CIA operatives were prominent among its clients, provides a good window into the political economy of drug dealing, money laundering, weapons smuggling, regime change and many much more criminal acts that took place along the road to 9/11.
    The BCCI was a key site of financial transactions that contributed to the end of the Cold War and the inception of many new kinds of conflict. These activities often involved the well-financed activities of mercenaries, proxy armies, and a heavy reliance on private contractors of many sorts.
    The Enron scandal was seen to embody some of the same lapses facilitated by fraudulent accounting integral to the BCCI scandal. Given the bubble of secrecy surrounding the Federal Reserve, there are thick barriers blocking deep investigation into whether or not the US Central Bank was involved in the relationship of the US national security establishment and the BCCI.
    The kind of dark transactions that the BCCI was designed to facilitate must have been channelled after its demise into other banking institutions probably with Wall Street connections. Since 9/11 , however, many emergency measures have been imposed that add extra layers of secrecy protecting the perpetrators of many criminal acts from public exposure and criminal prosecutions.
    The events of 9/11 have sometimes been described as the basis of a global coup. To this day there is no genuine consensus about what really transpired to create the illusion of justification for repeated US military invasions of Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East and Eurasia.
    The 9/11 debacle and the emergency measures that followed presented Wall Street with an array of new opportunities for profit that came with the elaborate refurbishing and retooling of the military-industrial complex.
    The response to 9/11 was expanded and generalized upon to create the basis of a war directed not at a particular enemy, but rather at an ill-defined conception identified as “terrorism.” This alteration was part of a complex of changes adding trillions to the flow of money energizing the axis of interaction linking the Pentagon and Wall Street and the abundance of new companies created to advance the geopolitical objectives emerging from the 9/11 coup.
    According to Pam Martens and Russ Martens, the excesses of deregulation helped induce an anything-goes-ethos on Wall Street and at its Federal Reserve regulator in the wake of 9/11. As the authors tell it, the response to 9/11 helped set important precedents for the maintaining flows of credit and capital in financial markets.
    Often the destination of the funds generated in the name of pumping liquidity into markets was not identified and reported in transactions classified as financial emergency measures. While the priority was on keeping financial pumps primed, there was much less concern for transparency and accountability among those in positions of power at the Federal Reserve.
    The financial sector’s capture of the government instruments meant to regulate the behaviour of Wall Street institutions was much like the deregulation of the US pharmaceutical industry. Both episodes highlight a message that has become especially insistent as the twenty-first century unfolds.
    The nature of the response to 9/11 emphasized the mercenary ascent of corporate dominance as the primary force directing governments. Throughout this transformation the message to citizens became increasingly clear. Buyer Beware. We cannot depend on governments to represent our will and interests. We cannot even count on our governments to protect citizens from corporatist attacks especially on human health and whatever financial security we have been able to build up.
    Bailouts, Derivatives, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
    The elimination of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 was essential to the process of dramatically cutting back the government’s role as a protector of the public interest on the financial services sector. The Glass-Steagall Act was an essential measure in US President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. Some view the New Deal as a strategy for saving capitalism by moderating ts most sharp-edged features. Instituted in 1933 in response to the onset of the Great Depression, the Glass-Steagall Act separated the operations of deposit-accepting banks from the more speculative activity of investment brokers.
    The termination of the regulatory framework put in place by the Glass Steagall Act opened much new space for all kinds of experiments in the manipulation of money in financial markets. The changes began with the merger of different sorts of financial institutions including some in the insurance field. Those overseeing the reconstituted entities headquartered on Wall Street took advantage of their widened latitudes of operation. They developed all sorts of ways of elaborating their financial services and presenting them in new packages.
    The word, “derivative” is often associated with many applications of the new possibilities in the reconstituted financial services sector. The word, derivative, can be applied to many kinds of transactions involving speculative bets of various sorts. As the word suggests, a derivative is derived from a fixed asset such as currency, bonds, stocks, and commodities. Alterations in the values of fixed assets affect the value of derivatives that often take the form of contracts between two or more parties.
    One of the most famous derivatives in the era of the financial crash of 2007-2010 was described as mortgaged-backed securities. On the surface these bundles of debt-burdened properties might seem easy to understand. But that would be a delusion. The value of these products was affected, for instance, by unpredictable shifts in interest rates, liar loans extended to homebuyers who lacked the capacity to make regular mortgage payments, and significant shifts in the value of real estate.
    Mortgage-backed securities were just one type of a huge array of derivatives invented on the run in the heady atmosphere of secret and unregulated transactions between counterparties. Derivatives could involve contracts formalizing bets between rivals gambling on the outcome of competitive efforts to shape the future. An array of derivative bets was built around transactions often placed behind the veil of esoteric nomenclature like “collateralized debt obligations” or “credit default swaps.”
    The variables in derivative bets might include competing national security agendas involving, for instance, pipeline constructions, regime change, weapons development and sales, false flag terror events, or money laundering. Since derivative bets involve confidential transactions with secret outcomes, they can be derived from all sorts of criteria. Derivative bets can, for instance, involve all manner of computerized calculations that in some cases are constructed much like war game scenarios.
    The complexity of derivatives became greater when the American Insurance Group, AIG, began selling insurance programs to protect all sides in derivative bets from suffering too drastically from the consequences of being on the losing side of transactions.
    The derivative frenzy, sometimes involving bets being made by parties unable to cover potential losses, overwhelmed the scale of the day-to-day economy. The “real economy” embodies exchanges of goods, services, wages and such that supply the basic necessities for human survival with some margin for recreation, travel, cultural engagement and such.
    The Swiss-based Bank of International Settlements calculated in 2008 that the size of the all forms of derivative products had a monetary value of $1.14 quadrillion. A quadrillion is a thousand trillions. By comparison, the estimated value of all the real estate in the world was $75 trillion in 2008.
    [ Bank for International Settlements , Semiannual OTC derivative statistics at end-December , 2008.]
    As the enticements of derivative betting preoccupied the leading directors of Wall Street institutions, their more traditional way of relating to one another began to falter. It was in this atmosphere that the Repo Market became problematic in December of 2007 just as it showed similar signs of breakdown in September of 2019.
    In both instances the level of distrust between those in charge of financial institutions began to falter because they all had good reason to believe that their fellow bankers were overextended. All had reason to believe their counterparts were mired by too much speculative activity enabled by all sorts of novel experiments including various forms of derivative dealing.
    In December of 2007 as in the autumn of 2019, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was forced to enter the picture to keep the financial pumps on Wall Street primed. The New York Fed kept the liquidity cycles flowing by invoking its power to create new money with the interest charged to tax payers.
    As the financial crisis unfolded in 2008 and 2009 the Federal Reserve, but especially the privately-owned New York Federal Reserve bank, stepped forward to bail out many financial institutions that had become insolvent or near insolvent. In the process precedents and patterns were established that are being re-enacted with some modifications in 2020.
    One of the innovations that took place in 2008 was the decision by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to hire a large Wall Street financial institution, BlackRock, to administer the bailouts. These transfers of money went through three specially created companies now being replicated as Special Purpose Vehicles in the course of the payouts of 2020.
    In 2008-09 BlackRock administered the three companies named after the address of the New York Federal Reserve Bank on Maiden Lane. BlackRock emerged from an older Wall Street firm called Blackstone. Its former chair, Peter C. Peterson, was a former Chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
    The original Maiden Lane company paid Bear Stearns Corp $30 billion. This amount from the New York Fed covered the debt of Bear Stearns, a condition negotiated to clear the way for the purchase of the old Wall Street institution by JP Morgan Chase. Maiden Lane II was a vehicle for payouts to companies that had purchased “mortgage-backed securities” before these derivative products turned soar.
    Maiden Lane III was to pay off “multi-sector collateralized debt obligations.” Among these bailouts were payoffs to the counterparties of the insurance giant, AIG. As noted, AIG had developed an insurance product to be sold to those engaged in derivative bets. When the bottom fell out of markets, AIG lacked the means to pay off the large number of insurance claims made against it. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York stepped in to bail out the counterparties of AIG, many of them deemed to be “too big to fail.”
    Among the counterparties of AIG was Goldman Sachs. It received of $13 billion from the Federal Reserve. Other bailouts to AIG’s counterparties were $12 billion to Deutsche Bank, $6.8 billion to Merrill Lynch, $5 billion to Switzerland’s UBS, $7.9 billion to Barclays, and $5.2 billion to Bank of America. Some of these banks received additional funds from other parts of the overall bailout transaction. Many dozens of other counterparties to AIG also received payouts in 2008-2009. Among them were the Bank of Montreal and Bank of Scotland.
    The entire amount of the bailouts was subsequently calculated to be a whopping $29 trillion with a “t.” The lion’s share of these funds went to prop up US financial institutions and the many foreign banks with which they conducted business.
    Much of this money went to the firms that were shareholders in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or partners of the big Wall Street firms. Citigroup, the recipient of the largest amount, received about $2.5 trillion in the federal bailouts. Merrill Lynch received $2 trillion,
    The Federal Reserve Bank was established by Congressional statute in 1913. The Federal Reserve headquarters is situated in Washington DC. The Central Bank was composed of twelve constituent regional banks. Each one of these regional banks is owned by private banks.
    The private ownership of the banks that are the proprietors of the Federal Reserve system has been highly contentious from its inception. The creation of the Federal Reserve continues to be perceived by many of its critics as an unjustifiable giveaway whereby the US government ceded to private interests its vital capacity to issue its own currency and to direct monetary policy like the setting of interest rates.
    Pam Martens and Russ Martens at Wall Street on Parade explain the controversial Federal Reserve structure as follows
    While the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. is deemed an “independent federal agency,” with its Chair and Governors appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, the 12 regional Fed banks are private corporations owned by the member banks in their region. The settled law under John L. Lewis v. the United States confirms: “Each Federal Reserve Bank is a separate corporation owned by commercial banks in its region.”
    In the case of the New York Fed, which is located in the Wall Street area of Manhattan, its largest shareowners are behemoth multinational banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
    There was no genuine effort after the financial debacle of 2007-2010 to correct the main structural problems and weaknesses of the Wall Street-based US financial sector. The Dodd-Frank Bill signed into law by US President Barack Obama in 2010 did make some cosmetic changes. But the main features of the regulatory capture that has taken place with the elimination of the Glass-Steagall Act remained with only minor alterations. In particular the framework was held in place for speculative excess in derivative bets.
    In the summer edition of The Atlantic , Frank Partnoy outlined a gloomy assessment of the continuity leading from the events of 2007-2010 to the current situation. This current situation draws a strange contrast between the lockdown-shattered quality of the economy and the propped-up value of the stock market whose future value will in all probability prove unsustainable. Partnoy writes,
    It is a distasteful fact that the present situation is so dire in part because the banks fell right back into bad behavior after the last crash—taking too many risks, hiding debt in complex instruments and off-balance-sheet entities, and generally exploiting loopholes in laws intended to rein in their greed. Sparing them for a second time this century will be that much harder.
    Wall Street Criminality on Display
    The frauds and felonies of the Wall Street banks have continued after the future earnings of US taxpayers returned them to solvency after 2010. The record of infamy is comparable to that of the pharmaceutical industry.
    The criminal behaviour in both sectors is very relevant to the overlapping crises that are underway in both the public health and financial sectors. In 2012 the crime spree in the financial sector began with astounding revelations about the role of many major banks in the LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate. The LIBOR rates create the basis of interest rates involved in the borrowing and lending of money in the international arena.
    When the scandal broke there were 35 different LIBOR rates involving various types of currency and various time frames for loans between banks. The rates were calculated every day based on information forwarded from 16 different banks to a panel on London. The reporting banks included Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, UBS, and Deutsche Bank. The influence of the LIBOR rate extended beyond banks to affect the price of credit in many types of transactions.
    The emergence of information that the banks were working together to rig the interest rate created the basis for a huge economic scandal. Fines extending from hundreds of millions into more than a billion dollars were placed on each of the offending banks. But in this instance and many others to follow, criminality was attached to the financial entities but not to top officials responsible for the decisions that put their corporations on the wrong side of the law.
    One of the factors in the banking frauds comprising the LIBOR scandal was the temptation to improve the chance for financial gains in derivative bets. The biggest failure of the federal response to the financial meltdown of 2007-210 was that little was done to curb the excesses of transactions in the realm of derivatives.
    Derivatives involved a form of gambling that exists in a kind of twilight zone. This twilight zone fills a space somewhere between the realm of the real economy and the realm of notional value. Notional values find expression in unrealized speculation about what might or might not come to fruition; what might or might not happen; who might win and who might lose in derivative speculations.
    The addiction of Wall Street firms to derivative betting remains unchecked to this day. The bankers’ continuing fixation with unregulated gambling, often with other people’s money, is deeply menacing for the future of the global economy…. indeed for the future of everyone on earth. According to the Office of the Controller of Currency, in 2019 JP Morgan Chase had $59 trillion in derivative bets. In July of 2020 it emerged that Citigroup held $62 trillion in derivative contracts, about $30 trillion more than it held before it was bailed out in 2008. In 2019 Goldman Sachs held $47 trillion and Bank of America held $20.4 trillion in derivate bets.
    A big part of the scandal embodied in these figures is embedded in the reality that all of these banks carry their most risky derivative bets in units of their corporate networks that are protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This peril played a significant part in deepening the crisis engendered by financial meltdown that began in 2007.
    One of the most redeeming features of the Dodd-Frank Act as originally drafted was a provision preventing financial institutions from keeping their derivative portfolios in banks whose deposits and depositors were backed up by federal insurance.
    Citigroup led the push in Congress in 2014 to allow Wall Street institutions to revert back to a more deregulated and danger-prone economic environment. The notoriously inept decisions and actions of Citigroup had played a significant role in the lead up to the financial debacle of 2007 to 2010. Since 2016 Citigroup has become once again the biggest risk taker by loading itself up with more derivative speculations than any other financial institution in the world.
    By returning derivative speculations to the protections of federal financial backstops, taxpayers are once again forced to assume responsibility for the most outlandish risks of Wall Street’s high rollers. It is taxpayers who are the backers of the federal government when it comes to their commitment to compensate banks for losses, even when these losses come about from derivative bets.
    How much more Wall Street risk and public debt can be loaded onto taxpayers and even onto generations of taxpayers yet unborn? How is national debt to be understood when it plunders working people to guarantee and augment the wealth of the most privileged branches of society? Why should those most responsible for creating the most excessive risks to the financial wellbeing of our societies be protected from bearing the consequences of the very risks they themselves created?
    Along with Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase stands out among a group of financial sector reprobates most deeply involved in sketchy activities that extend deep into the realm of criminality. In a simmering scandal six of JP Morgan Chase’s traders have been accused of breaking laws in conducting the bank’s futures trading in the value of precious metals. They have been accused of violating the RICO statute , a law meant for people suspected of being part of organized crime.
    In the charges pressed by the Justice Department on JP Morgan Chase ’s traders it is alleged that they “conducted the affairs of the [minerals] desk through a pattern of racketeering activity, specifically, wire fraud affecting a financial institution and bank fraud.”
    In 2012 JP Morgan Chase faced a $1 billion fine for its role in the “London Wale” series of derivative bets described as follows by the Chair of the US Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation. Senator Carl Levin explained, “Our findings open a window into the hidden world of high stakes derivatives trading by big banks. It exposes a derivatives trading culture at JPMorgan that piled on risk, hid losses, disregarded risk limits, manipulated risk models, dodged oversight, and misinformed the public.”
    Traders at Goldman Sachs appear to have been part of the Wall Street crime spree. The tentacles of corruption in the Goldman Sachs case apparently extend deep into the US Justice Department. The case involves allegations of embezzlement, money laundering and missing billions. These manifestations of malfeasance all spin out of a scandal-prone Malaysian sovereign wealth fund administered by Goldman Sachs.
    A big part of the scandal reported in Wall Street on Parade in July of 2020 involves the fact that the Justice Department’s prosecutors seem to be dragging their feet in this possible criminal felony case against Goldman Sachs . The prosecutors, including the US Attorney-General, William Barr, worked previously for the law firm, Kirkland and Ellis. Kirkland and Ellis was retained to defend Goldman Sachs in this matter.
    Pam Martens and Russ Martens express dismay at the failure of US officialdom to hold Wall Street institutions accountable for the crime spree of some of its biggest firms. They write, “Congress and the executive branch of the government seem determined to protect Wall Street criminals, which simply assures their proliferation.”
    Even racketeering charges against officials at JP Morgan Chase, where Jamie Dimon presides as CEO, failed to receive any attention from the professional deceivers that these days dominate MSM. The star reporters of Wall Street on Parade write, “Crime and fraud are so de rigueur at the bank led by Dimon that not one major newspaper ran the headline [of the racketeering charge] on the front page or anywhere else in the paper.
    While federal charges that JP Morgan Chase’s Wall Street operation engaged in criminal racketeering was not of interest to the press, Jamie Dimon ’s surprise visit in early June to a Chase branch in Mt. Kisco New York aroused considerable media attention. Dimon was photographed with staff wearing a mask and taking the knee. By participating in this ritual Dimon signaled that his Wall Street operation is in league with the sometimes violent cancel culture pushed into prominence by the Democratic Party in partnership with Black Lives Matter and Antifa. *(JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon takes a knee with employees in front of a bank vault.

    In an article on 21 July marking ten years since the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 , the Martens duo conclude, “So here we are today, watching the Fed conduct another secret multi-trillion dollar bailout of Wall Street while the voices of Congress and mainstream media are nowhere to be heard.”
    Enter BlackRock
    In March it was announced that representatives of the US Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Board and the BlackRock financial management were joining forces to make adjustments in the US economy. The aim was to address the financial dislocations resulting from the decision to lock down businesses, citizens, schools, entertainment, and social mingling outside the home, all in response to the health care hysteria promoted by governments and their media extensions.
    The format of this process suggested some relaxation in the strict distinctions historically drawn between the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve. What would be the role of the third member of the group? In reflecting on this topic Joyce Nelson observed, “the new bailout bill not only further erases the line between the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury, it places BlackRock effectively in an overseer position for both.”
    Some saw as symbolically instructive the delegation to BlackRock of a larger role than that assigned it during the first bailout of 2007-2008. It would be hard to overestimate the significance of this prominent Wall Street firm’s return to a strategic role near the very heart of this major exercise of federal power. This invitation to take part in such crucial negotiations at such a consequential juncture in history caused some to characterize BlackRock as a “fourth branch of government.”
    As Victoria Guida commented in Politico , “This is a transformational moment for the Fed, and BlackRock’s now going to be in an even stronger position to serve the Fed in the future.”
    BlackRock officials had been instrumental in helping to manoeuvre their company into such a strategic role by responding proactively to the understanding in some elite circles that another financial debacle was imminent. Only months before the financial meltdown actually occurred a group of former central bankers all commissioned by BlackRock delivered a recovery plan in August of 2019.
    Presented at a G 7 summit of central bankers in Jackson Hole Wyoming, the plan for the government responses to the looming financial collapse was entitled Dealing with the Next Downturn . Its authors are Stanley Fischer, former Governor of the Central Bank of Israel, Philipp Hildebrande, former Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, Jean Boivin, former Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, and Elga Bartsch, Economist at Morgan Stanley.
    The BlackRock Team at Jackson Hole put forward the case that a more aggressive and coordinated combination of monetary and fiscal policy must be brought to the job of stimulating a financial recovery. Monetary policy includes the setting of interest rates. Where monetary policy has historically been the domain of the central banks, fiscal policy, involving issues of taxation as well as the content and size of government budgets, lies within the jurisdiction of elected legislatures.
    The nub of the proposal to unite fiscal and monetary policy put the US Treasury and the US Federal Reserve on the same political platform. As the author of this merger of monetary and fiscal policy, BlackRock became third member of the triumvirate charged to address the broad array of economic maladies that arrived in the wake of the lockdowns.
    In the spring of 2020 BlackRock has been hired by the Bank of Canada and by Sweden’s Central Bank, the Riksbank, to deliver on the approaches to crisis management its representatives had laid out at Jackson Hole. BlackRock’s most high-profile and strategic engagement, however, began with its involvement in the negotiation of the $2 trillion CARES stimulus package that passed through the US Congress in March of 2020.
    The CARES Act included $367 billion for loans and grants to small business, $130 billion for health care systems, $150 billion for state and local government, $500 billion for loans to corporate America, and $25 billion for airlines (in addition to loans).
    The heart of the plan involved a payout of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child for households making up to $75,000. This payment to citizens approaches the concept of disseminating “helicopter money” as referred to in BlackRock’s initial outline for dealing with the “downturn.” Helicopter money distributed by the federal government to its citizens was also related to the concept of “going direct” in strategies for stimulating the economy.
    BlackRock seems to be moving into the space recently held by Goldman Sachs as Wall Street’s best embodiment of ostentatious success including in the preparation of its corporate leaders for high-ranking positions in the federal government. Laurence Fink, BlackRock’s founder and CEO, might well have replicated this career path to become Treasury Secretary if Hillary Clinton had succeeded in becoming US President in 2016.
    BlackRock’s leadership went to great lengths to avoid being tagged with the title in the United States of a “systematically important financial institution” (sifi). To be subject to this “sifi” label entails added federal scrutiny and regulation as well as heightened requirements to keep high amounts of capital on hand. BlackRock’s status as a private company not subject to sifi regulations makes the financial management firm more attractive to its federal partners in the federal payout operation presently underway.
    One of the reasons for including a private company in the trio of partners involved in the payouts is to sneak around limitations on the legal powers of the Federal Reserve. As explained by Ellen Brown in her essay, Meet BlackRock: The New Great Vampire Squid , the Federal Reserve can only purchase “safe federally-guaranteed assets.” As a private company, BlackRock apparently faces no such restrictions . It can purchase more risky assets not backstopped by federal insurance.
    The regional banks of the Federal Reserve Board are owned by private companies whose directors seem to have been part of the decision to include BlackRock in the implementation of the CARES process. There can be no doubt that the format of the CARES negotiations pulled the supposedly independent Federal Reserve more deeply into the political orbit of the US Treasury branch. The presence of a major Wall Street firm in the process, however, apparently gave the advocates of the Fed’s supposed independence from politics a sense that they retained some leverage in the process.
    The inclusion of private companies in the conduct of government business has become in recent decades a very common expression of neoliberalism. One of the reasons for this embrace of public-private partnerships in the conduct of government business is to take advantage of the legal nature of private companies. The apportionment to private companies of significant roles in deciding and implementing public policies helps put veils of secrecy over the true nature of government decisions and actions.
    Private companies can more easily assert claims to “proprietary information” than can public institutions when they act on behalf of citizens. This feature of privatization in the performance of public responsibilities by elected government runs counter to the imperatives of democratic transparency. It puts obstacles in the way of genuine accountability because the public is more likely to be kept in the dark about key aspects of what is being decided and done on their behalf.
    Suck Up Economics and State Monopoly Capitalism
    BlackRock owns, controls, or manages about $30 trillion in total in securities. It directly controls or owns somewhat less than a third of this amount. The remainder of the assets BlackRock manages are to service clients responsible for taking care of pension funds, philanthropies, foundations, endowments, family offices, superannuation funds and such.
    A big part of BlackRock’s business model involves attracting customers by allowing them access to great masses of timely information of significant utility to those responsible for making investment decisions. This technological wizardry happens on a very advanced computational platform known as Aladdin.
    Aladdin remains a work-in-progress, one that is widely recognized as the most sophisticated medium of its kind for assessing all manner of financial risks and potentials for profit. Its future as an investment platform is to become more and more integrated into the complex mix of hardware and software animating Artificial Intelligence.
    BlackRock’s job is to dispense funds ushered into existence through the money-creating powers of the Federal Reserve. These transactions are to take place through eleven so-called “special purpose vehicles” similar to the Maiden Lane companies that BlackRock administered during the prior bailouts.
    The funds it distributes in this round starting in 2020 are meant, at least at this early stage of the crisis, as payments for various sorts of assets. These assets might include an array of corporate bonds spanning a range from so-called investment grade to garbage grade junk bonds. The losses incurred in this exchange, involving supposed assets that might turn out to be worthless, or loans that might not be paid back, are to be charged to the US Treasury. Ultimately the liability lies on US taxpayers who are the holders of the national debt.
    Bonds of varying levels of worth lie beneath another asset eligible for transformation into cash. This instrument of value is referred to as Exchange Traded Funds, ETFs. ETFs happen to be a specialty of BlackRock ever since the company launched a range of commercial ETFs into Stock Market circulation through its iShares division. BlackRock’s role on both sides of buying and selling ETFs comes up repeatedly as one of the many conflicts of interest of which the Wall Street firm stands accused.
    Given that BlackRock is involved in one way or another in the proprietorship of pretty much every major company in the world, there is plenty to back up the allegation that Black Rock is an interested party in most of the transactions in which it engages as part of its partnership with the US Fed and Treasury Branch.
    Pam Matens and Russ Martens have been very critical of the role of the Federal Reserve and BlackRock in the current economic crisis. They have anticipated that, if the current drift of events continues, American taxpayers will once again be gobsmacked with a huge growth in the national debt. This development would amount to another major transfer of wealth away from working people to the beneficiaries of Wall Street firms and the same commercial institutions that received the lion’s share of funds during the last bailout.
    The co-authors picture BlackRock is part of a scheme to use “Special Purpose Vehicles” like “Enron used to hide the true state of its finances and blow itself up.” They entitle their article published on 31 March, 2020 as “The Dark Secrets in the Fed’s Wall Street Bailout Are Getting a Devious Makeover in Today’s Bailout.”
    The authors observe . “What makes the New York Fed’s bailout of Wall Street so much more dangerous this time around is that it has decided to use a different structure for its loans to Wall Street – one that will force losses on taxpayers and, it hopes, will provide an ironclad secrecy curtain around how much it spends and where the money goes.”
    I find this account of an effort by the Federal Reserve to create an “ironclad secrecy curtain” shocking under these circumstances. It suggests an intention to exceed the deceptiveness of the last bailout. This warning renews longstanding suspicions that the failures of transparency and accountability have not subsided since the beginning of the era when deregulation and the 9/11 deceptions converged in the domestic and international operations of Wall Street.
    The structural problems already identified in the process initiated to implement the CARES Act could have enormous consequences if the current economic crisis continues to deteriorate. This deterioration is not likely to stop anytime soon given the depth of the crash and its probable domino effects. It was reported in late July that during the second quarter of 2020 the US Gross Domestic Product collapsed at an annualized rate of 33%, the deepest decline in output ever recorded since the US government began measuring GDP in 1947.
    The CARES Act helped set in motion a program with the potential to repeat elements of the earlier bailout. The amount of $454 billion was to be set aside to assist the banking sector. The Fed can leverage this amount by ten times according to the principles of fractional reserve banking.
    The news of this development caused Mike Whitney to imagine “the Fed turning itself into a hedge fund in order to buy the sludge that has accumulated on the balance sheets of corporations and financial institutions for the last decade,” Whitney pictured an onslaught of “scheming sharpies who will figure out how to game the system and turn the whole fiasco into another Wall Street looting operation.”
    Meanwhile the Martens Team at Wall Street on Parade called attention to the $9 trillion already injected by the New York Fed to flood liquidity into the still-troubled Repo Markets that began to falter in September of 2019. Add to this revelation the news that the Fed “has not announced one scintilla of information on what specific Wall Street firms have received this money or how much they individually received.”
    There is no doubt that the nature of economic relations will be substantially altered in the process of dealing with the financial meltdown induced by the lockdowns and by the overreliance on high debt rates combined with artificially low interest rates prior to 2020. The altered political economy that is beginning to emerge following the lockdowns is sometimes described as state monopoly capitalism.
    In deciding what companies get bailed out and what companies don’t, the financial authorities that are intervening in this crisis are pretty much deciding what enterprises get the advantage of federal financial backstops and what enterprises will not enjoy government sanction. Increasingly, therefore, it is the state that determines winners and losers in the organizing of financial relations. This development further undermines any notion that some idealized vision of competition and market forces will determine winners and losers in the economy of the future.
    As Peter Ewarts has observed, it seems that BlackRock is being delegated by federal authorities to exercise “discretionary powers to pick winners and losers,” a choice that is “where the real bonanza and clout lies.” Will the winners be chosen from the companies run by executives that used the money gained from the prior bailouts to engage in stock buy backs? This process of buying back stock tends to be reflected in CEO bonuses and higher share prices. Alternatively this way of allocating funds tends to short change workers as well as innovation and efficiency in industrial production?
    Will companies be rewarded whose executives have moved production facilities overseas or issued billions in junk bonds? Will companies be rewarded whose directors have participated in the effort to censor the Internet, bring about lockdowns or foment mask hysteria? Why is it that the coddled elites serving the financial imperatives of most wealthy branches of society are being put in the best position to decide who gets a life preserver from the state and who must sink and drown?
    Might this bias be a factor in the current process that led Forbes Magazine to conclude in a headline that “ Billionaries Are Getting Richer During the Covid-19 Pandemic While Most Americans Suffer .”
    There can be no doubt that the financial transactions beginning with the CARES Act represent a crucial initial stage in what the promoters of the World Economic Forum have been labeling as the Great Reset. Laurence Fink and the BlackRock firm are significant participants in the World Economic Forum. The WEF helped introduce the pandemic in Event 201 in October of 2019 even as it is now trying to put a positive face on the fiasco.
    Why should the people most harshly affected by the lockdowns tolerate that the very Wall Street interests dispossessing them, are tasked once again to lead and exploit the reset of the financial system? As presently structured by the likes of BlackRock and its beneficiaries, this process is once again transferring new wealth to the most wealthy branches of society. Simultaneously it is burdening the rest of the population with yet another massive increase in both personal and national indebtedness.
    There is no more discussion of “trickle down” economics, a frequent metaphor invoked in the Reagan-Thatcher era. Instead we are in the midst of an increasingly intense phase of suck up economics. The rich are being further enriched and further empowered through the dispossession of the poor and the middle classes. This procedure, initiated when locked down citizens were sidelined from the political process, has the potential to result in the largest upward transfer of wealth so far in history.
    BlackRock Versus the Debt-Lite Legacy of the Bank of Canada
    At the end of March Laurence Fink, CEO and founder of BlackRock , announced in a letter to his company’s shareholder, “We are honored to have been selected to assist the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of Canada on programs designed to facilitate capital to businesses and support the economy.”
    This announcement might leave the impression that the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are similar institutions. This impression is unfounded. The two banks have very different structures and histories. A spotlight on these differences helps illuminate the nature of a number of core financial issues.
    These financial issues should command avid attention during this time of reckoning with a serious economic crisis that may well be still in its early stages. Such issues inevitably draw attention to the current manifestations of very old questions about the character of money and its relationship to the concepts of usury and debt. Questions about debt, debt enslavement as well as the possibility of debt renunciation or debt forgiveness are becoming especially pressing.
    These controversial queries arise in an era when a tiny minority is aggressively asserting sweeping claims to ownership of vast concentrations of the world’s available assets. The other side of this picture reveals that the largest mass of humanity is sinking into a swamp of rising debt on a scale that is concurrently unsustainable and unconscionable. How did this level of inequity reach such audacious extremes? Are there any remedies in sight?
    There is nothing to suggest structural remediation in the current approach to the economic crisis. In fact so far there is every indication that the current approach of bringing about an enormous expansion in the availability of debt-laden money will only compound the further dispossession of the already dispossessed in order to expand the wealth of the already wealthy.
    As already noted, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is one of twelve regional banks that together constitute the US Federal Reserve. Every regional Federal Reserve Bank is owned by a group of private banks. Each of the private banks at the base of a Federal Reserve regional bank marks its proprietorship through the ownership of shares. These shares cannot be freely traded in stock markets. The ownership of these shares expresses the private ownership of the US banking system.
    The Fed’s New York regional bank has a special role in money creation given its location at the heart of the US financial sector on and around Wall Street. In this crisis, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is creating new money in the name of holding back onslaughts of destitution and penury in a traumatized society. Ever since 1913 every new dollar brought into existence by the Federal Reserve, which is the central bank of the United States, creates added debt that collects compound interest as long as it is left unpaid.
    The Bank of Canada was created to counter the delegation of money-creating authority to privately-owned banks. The Bank of Canada was founded during the Great Depression, a time when the failure of many existing institutions created the conditions to try out alternative entities in the attempt to improve economic relationships.
    One of the driving forces in the creation of Canada’s new banking system was Gerald Gratten McGeer. McGreer was an elected official in British Columbia dedicated to changing the system so that the people of Canada could generate their own currency through the sovereign authority of Canada’s Parliament. McGeer helped to push the national government of Prime Minister R.B. Bennett in this direction. The wheels were set in motion in 1933 through the work on the Royal Commission on Banking and Currency.
    McGeer drew much of his inspiration from former US President, Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln led the US federal government throughout the US Civil War. To finance the Armed Forces of the Union, Lincoln used the authority of the federal government to create “Greenbacks” as a means of paying the troops. By employing the sovereign authority of the US government to create its own currency, Lincoln avoided the intrigues that often accompanied the process of borrowing money from foreign lenders.
    McGreer had obtained what he viewed as credible evidence that Lincoln had been assassinated because of his antagonism to the designs of private bankers seeking to widen their base of power in the United States. The Canadian politician had taken to heart a comment attributed often to Lincoln : “The privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of Government, but it is the Government’s greatest creative opportunity.”
    The Bank of Canada was created in 1934 and nationalized as a Crown Corporation in 1938. To this day it retains its founding charter that affirms ,
    WHEREAS it is desirable to establish a central bank in Canada to regulate credit and currency in the best interests of the economic life of the nation, to control and protect the external value of the national monetary unit and to mitigate by its influence fluctuations in the general level of production, trade, prices and employment, so far as may be possible within the scope of monetary action, and generally to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada.
    The Bank of Canada formed an essential basis of a very creative period of Canadian growth, development, and diversification throughout the middle decades of the twentieth century. The Bank of Canada created the capital that financed the Canadian war effort from 1939 until 1945. After the war the Bank of Canada lent money at very low rates of interest to the municipal, provincial and national governments. The monies were used for infrastructure projects and for investments to increase the wellbeing and creative potential of Canada’s most important resource, its people.
    This type of low interest or no interest financing formed the economic basis for projects like the creation of a national pension plan, national health care insurance, the Trans-Canada Highway, the St. Lawrence Seaway, the Avro-Arrow initiative as well as a formidable system of colleges and universities.
    One could say that the Bank of Canada provided an indigenous money supply that was spent into the operations of a fast growing economy greased with lots of federal liquidity. The new money derived its value from the efforts of Canadian workers. Together they brought about significant increases in the country’s net worth through practical improvements that bettered the lives of all citizens.
    Consider the contrast between this type of national development and the kind of larceny facilitated by the Federal Reserve’s infusions of the money it creates into Wall Street’s operations in the twenty-first century. In, for instance, the financial bailouts of 2007 to 2010 the largest part of the newly-created money ended up in the coffers of the wealthy whereas the new debt created ended up as part of a US national debt.
    The burden of carrying this debt falls inter-generationally on average working people who form the lion’s share of taxpayers. They have long been saddled with an “inextinguishable debt” that unrelentingly grows, hardly ever shrinks, and remains basically unpayable forever. The very concept of “compound interest” conveys the image of an overall debt spread out over many venues. This debt must grow in perpetuity. There is a constant need for additional debtors while existing debtors must face constantly growing personal debt.
    There is reason to suspect that the financial debacle of 2020 will re-enact some the worst excesses of the 2008 bailout. Might the payouts this time around to derivative-addicted Wall Street firms like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase exceed the scale of the prior bailout? Would there be any way of even knowing whether the current round of payouts outdoes the former round of bailouts? The current process of federal disbursements is not transparent. In fact the process has been described as one designed to “provide an ironclad secrecy curtain around how much [the Fed} spends and where the money goes.”
    Why is the Canadian government turning to the very firm that emerged as Wall Street’s main fixer and winner in the 2008 bailouts? Why is Justin Trudeau looking to BlackRock to respond to the Canadian aspects of the 2020 economic crash?
    Justin Trudeau seems unwilling or unable to provide a coherent answer to this question and others requiring thoughtful replies rather than barrages of platitudes. Why is Justin Trudeau instituting what Joyce Nelson has characterized as a “ new feudalism ” in Canada’s economic policies?
    Any decent effort of response on Trudeau’s part would have to make some reference to the background of the current debacle. There would have to be some acknowledgment that between 1934 and 1974 the Canada government did not build up any significant national debt. Then, between 1974 and 2020, the national debt of Canada skyrocketed from $22 billion to $700 billion.
    Why was such a good and sustainable use of the Bank of Canada put aside, one that contributed magnificently to the health and wellbeing of the Canadian people as well as the Canadian federation? Who lost out? Who gained besides the international bankers?
    The incomprehensible abandonment of a winning formula for Canadian development by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau puts a special onus on his son, Canada’s current PM, to explain the incredibly costly mistake of his father. Why won’t Justin Trudeau fix the mistake of his father and restore the Bank of Canada to its former role in Canadian nation building?
    There has never been a full and satisfactory explanation of what really happened in 1974 to persuade Pierre Trudeau to throw aside the means of developing infrastructure with resources generated internally within Canada. Trudeau Senior’s decision to stop building up Canada through the operation of the Canadian people’s own national bank was not debated in Parliament. The option was never part of an election platform let alone the subject of a national referendum.
    Apparently the Swiss-based Bank of International Settlements, which is often referred to as the central bank for central bankers, had some role in Pierre Trudeau’s decision to cease using the Bank of Canada’s powers to generate near-debt-free Canadian currency.
    Government as a Means of Escaping Debt Entrapment
    That powers of debt-lite money creation invested by Parliament in the Bank of Canada have never been formally withdrawn. The Bank of Canada could still revert back to the direct creation of Canadian currency to be spent into an economy of national recovery; to be spent in investments in infrastructure as well as in cultivating and applying the creative skills of the Canadian people.
    Between 2011 and 2017 a court case was brought against the government of Canada with the aim of restoring the Bank of Canada to its former role. As Rocco Galati, the lawyer for the Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform (COMER) explained “Not only has the government abandoned its constitutional duty to govern, but it has transferred it to international private banks which corresponds to an abandonment of its sovereignty.”
    After some significant rulings and contentious appeals, the COMER case came to an end without delivering results that its plaintiffs sought. But the court case helped to put a spotlight on the potential of the Bank of Canada. If properly utilized, this institution could provide a model corrective to the subordination of governance to the international Lords of Debt Explotation and their minions.
    This process of politicizing the role of the Bank of Canada should extend to a process of calling out Justin Trudeau’s current approach to selling off key components of Canada’s infrastructure.
    This topic came up in private discussions between Larry Fink and Justin Trudeau at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January of 2016. Fink apparently got Trudeau interested in attracting private investors to the project of improving or building Canadian infrastructure projects like roads, high-speed trains, airports and such. This kind of approach to developing infrastructure projects runs counter to the role once played by the Bank of Canada in incorporating self-sufficiency into the process of national building.
    The dangers and opportunities in this time of manufactured crises are indeed unprecedented. Instead of rejecting the Davos crowd’s preoccupation with a giant reset, why not embrace the concept? Why not treat this moment as an opening to reset the global economy in a way that would restore the Bank of Canada to some of its former functions. Why not highlight this return to the sovereign embrace of benevolent nation building as an example for the rest of the world?
    Why not reconstitute the worldwide structures of the international system of economic relations to restore elected governments to the functions that have been pre-empted by unaccountable institutions like the US Federal Reserve or the Bank for International Settlements? Why not renew the model of banking as an exercise and expression of national sovereignty and the self-determination of peoples in a dynamic global arena of rules-based economic interaction?
    Why not withdraw the power from private bankers to create national currencies? Why not follow the advice of the deceased Abraham Lincoln by restoring “the greatest of all creative possibilities available to governments,” namely their power to issue money and set interest rates. The restoration of economic power to governments and the people and peoples they represent would involve the infusion of life into conceptions of globalization very different than those used to justify the industrialization of China and the deindustrialization of North America.
    By delegating to international organizations much of their capacity to influence the economic conditions affecting their own people, national legislatures have lost much of their capacity to provide responsible government. Governments thus weakened are not realistically in a position to derive their authority from the consent of the governed. When representative bodies cannot effectively express the right of their constituents to collective self-determination in economic realm, what legitimacy is left to the institution of representative government?
    This strange moment puts humanity face to face with much that is novel and unprecedented and much that is old and integral to the history of human interaction. The economic dimensions of this crisis constitute its most devastating and far-reaching attribute. The supposed remedy being rushed into operation is to flood large quantities of debt-laden loans into existence and for governments to distribute the borrowed funds to individuals, businesses, and organizations as they see fit.
    Once again, vast quantities of debt-laden money are being created without the informed consent of those on whose shoulders the vastly increased loads of debt are falling. Once again governments are rewarding political friends and punishing political enemies by means of the way the new funds are being apportioned.
    Decisions are pushed forward that emanate not from citizen constituents but from cabals of supranational connivers actively engaged in wrecking what little remains of responsible government. As governments lose legitimacy by engaging in collusion with corrupt cronies and international crime syndicates they must depend more and more on police state thuggery to enforce some semblance of order.
    This process is going forward in spite of the fact that alternative means exist to create as much new money as is required without having to pay large amounts of compound interest to private bankers. Every sovereign government has the capacity to generate new money by following the model of the Bank of Canada between 1938 and 1974.
    There is an especially urgent need at this time for some serious reckoning with the economic dimensions of the crisis before us. This reckoning will inevitably meet the resistance of extremely powerful interests who are deriving great benefits from the existing system. The process of privatizing the creation of money has enriched and empowered a clique whose institutionalized, deep-rooted and continuing kleptocracy was exposed in part by the bailout of 2008.
    Why should we take for granted in 2020 that the best way to deal with the economic debacle put before us is to create new money by agreeing to go much deeper into a quagmire of debt entrapment. This debt trap, whose cumulative amount will soon be more that $300 trillion globally, creates gross liabilities in a trajectory of disadvantage that severely limits the life chances even of many generations still unborn.
    The other side of debt is embodied in assets. Who gets the assets and who gets the liabilities that coalesce to form indebtedness? What is to be made of the role of birth or inheritance or race or natural ability or social connections in apportioning assets or imposing the enslavements of accumulated debt?
    John Perkins addressed some of these issues in his Confessions of an Economic Hit Man and in a subsequent follow-up volume. Perkins chronicled how an inter-related complex of US institutions aligned themselves with his own greedy and unscrupulous interventions. The goal of their coordinated aggressions was aimed at imposing the enslavements of massive debt with compound interest. Their version of loan sharking is one of many manifestations expressing a very old and common phenomenon. It often happens that powerful interests parasitically exploit the weak to further enrich themselves.
    This partnership between John Perkins and the kleptocratic agencies directed by the US government has long been drawing wealth from struggling countries by pushing them more deeply into national indebtedness. Once the governments of target countries succumbed to greater dependence on debt-based financing, the conditions were ripe to force officials into adopting policies of austerity that harmed local citizens in order to augment the assets of international investors.
    Significantly the World Bank demonstrated how this coercion works in the context of the current economic crisis. The World Bank attempted to impose conditions on a loan of $940 million to Belarus because the WB w",

    title: "Warren Buffet Turns Positive on Gold, Negative On Banks",
    text: " Saturday, August 22, 2020 Warren Buffet Turns Positive on Gold, Negative On Banks The writing is on the wall and as I have written about numerous times , Central Banks are well aware of the necessity to move a significant portion of their reserves into gold bullion, which is exactly why they have been net positive buyers over the last couple of years.Central Banks have steadily been increasing their holdings, while the rest of the masses foolishly ignored the safety of precious metals, even while the risks continued to mount all around them.This of course does not include everyone, but in the grand scheme of the investment community, those who have been partaking in the steady accumulation of precious metals is a dedicated, but small percentage of the overall markets.I believe that this is set to change and in a very, very significant way.One of my predication's at the start of this year, was that 2020 was going to see the institutional investor change their opinion on investing in precious metals, leading to a boon for the metals as the "smart money" began to pile into both gold and silver bullion, resulting in a renewal of the bull market.This is exactly what we are starting to see, as arguably the most renowned investor in the world, Warren Buffet has made a significant move into the precious metals marketplace. Warren Buffet Moves on Gold On August 14th, there was 13F filing update within the United States, which gives valuable insight into what the "smart money" is currently buying and putting their funds towards.Many other market participants respect these investors and will often take their lead, investing their funds into what the "smart money" has already moved in on, often causing a self fulfilling trend to occur.Warren Buffet is one of the most watched names within these filings, as he has been heralded by many as one of the greatest investors of all time.Therefore it shocked and stunned many within the markets when it was revealed through these 13F filings , that Berkshire Hathaway’s activity showed a drastic change in course, with the fund making a major move on the Canadian mining company, Barrick Gold.As indicated through the filings, Berkshire Hathaway purchased 21 million shares, which equates to nearly $564 million worth of Barrick Gold, making it one of the largest investments for Warren Buffet in 2020.This comes as even more of a shock to many, given Warren Buffet's historic disdain for investing in precious metals.To those who do not believe in the protection that precious metals can offer in a time of crisis, this severe change in course from one of the most seasoned investors should come as major warning as to just how dire things have become. Buffet Turns Negative on the Broader Markets The other cause for concern that should have many investors who are blindly buying into this artificially inflated stock market, is not only what Buffet bought, but also what he sold.In what many consider to be a negative indicator for the U.S. economy moving forward, Warren Buffet dumped almost the entirety of his shares in Goldman Sachs, selling nearly 2 million shares of the stock.And he didn't stop there.In addition to shedding his position in Goldman Sachs, Buffet also sold out of 61% of his position in JPMorgan Chase and nearly a quarter of his position in Wells Fargo.Finally, as indicated in the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, they heavily sold out of their position in airline companies, further indicating that he likely sees a prolonged downturn for the U.S. and even global economy.Famed precious metals and bitcoin bull, Max Keiser gave his opinion on what these moves by Buffet mean; I couldn't agree more, as it is indeed a strong indication of just how unstable things have become and just how much risk is present in today's financial markets around the globe. In Conclusion Ill-regardless of Warren Buffet making a major move on the gold markets, while also shedding some of the largest banking names in the world, the fact of the matter remains that the fundamentals for precious metals remain rock solid.These actions only further support the fundamentals and will help perpetuate the positive trend higher for both gold and silver bullion as we move forward.Additional institutional investors are already taking notice of the moves Warren Buffet has made and as many of them have in the past, will follow in his wake in the coming days, months and years.Prices will gyrate, volatility will be extreme.However, a steady increase higher is all but assured at this point, as the metals account for the historic amount of fiat money that the world has created out of thin air and of which will never be taken back out of the system.Remember, the trend is your friend until the end and the trend for precious metals is strong indeed.Stay safe and keep stacking. - Source, Nathan McDonald via Sprott Money Blog at",

And this issue is not faced by 1 or 2 people. Almost all users are facing the same problem. So problem is definitely at the application server level. Kindly resolve this issue or the users will start to reduce. This may also reduce your stock market value.",

    text: "AP Rarely has that adage been as clear as it is now. An amazing, monthslong rally has put the S&P 500 back to where it was before the coronavirus slammed the U.S, even though millions of workers are still getting unemployment benefits and businesses continue to shutter across the country. The S&P 500, which is the benchmark index for stock funds at the heart of many 401(k) accounts, ended Tuesday at 3,389.78, eclipsing the previous high set on Feb. 19 and erasing all of the 34% plunge from February into March in less time than it takes a baby to learn how to crawl. The U.S. and global economies have shown some improvements since the spring, when business lockdowns were widespread, but they are nowhere close to fully healed. The number of virus cases continues to rise across much of the United States, and federal and local politicians for the most part lack a strategy to contain it. Many industries, such as airlines, hotels and dining, could take years to recover from the damage. The Federal Reserve and the U.S. government get a lot of the credit for the rally after pouring trillions of dollars into the economy. Profits also remained incredibly resilient for the stock market’s most influential companies, such as Apple and Amazon. Rising hopes for a potential vaccine to halt the pandemic, meanwhile, have encouraged investors to look past the current dreary statistics. Here’s a look at how Wall Street has flourished while Main Street struggles: THE MARKET’S BIG GUNS The corner bars, the family restaurants, the hair salons and other small businesses across the U.S. that are teetering or closing for good aren’t listed on the stock market. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google’s parent company are, and movements in their stocks alone are dictating the action in the S&P 500 more than ever before. The pandemic has accelerated work-at-home and other trends that have boosted Big Tech, and their profits are piling up. The five big tech-oriented giants are now worth a combined $7.6 trillion, and by themselves account for about 23% of the S&P 500′s total value. Because stocks with the biggest market values carry the most weight in the S&P 500, the movements of Big Tech matter much more than what airlines, cruise-ship operators or other still-struggling companies are doing. American Airlines is down more than 50% for 2020 so far, but its much smaller market value means it doesn’t move the needle like Big Tech. It would take 280 American Airlines to have the heft of one Apple. The stock market has seen some broadening out of gains recently, with stocks of smaller companies doing better. But Big Tech has done the heaviest lifting in the S&P 500′s rally. HELP FROM WASHINGTON A famous saying on Wall Street is: Don’t fight the Fed. The central bank is doing everything it can to support the economy, from cutting interest rates to nearly zero to the unprecedented promise to buy even riskier corporate debt. It’s all aimed at ensuring lending markets have enough cash to run smoothly and to prevent prices from going haywire. Economists say the moves have helped avoid a 2008-09 style meltdown of the financial system. The Fed has signaled that it will keep its benchmark short-term interest rate at nearly zero through at least 2022, and low rates are often like steroids for stocks. With Treasurys and other bonds paying relatively little in interest, some investors are turning instead to stocks, gold and other investments, boosting their prices. Congress also approved an unprecedented amount of aid for the economy. Some portions of that aid have already expired, and another economic relief package is tied up in partisan rancor on Capitol Hill. But many investors seem to expect Washington to eventually come to a compromise and throw another lifeline to the economy. Meanwhile, the economy is recovering but at a much slower pace than its rapid collapse in the spring. After shrinking at an annual pace of 32.9% in the April-June quarter, economists forecast it will rebound at a 20% annual pace in the July-September period. The unemployment rate is 10.2% and is expected to remain in the high single-digits through at least the end of this year. THE NATURE OF THE MARKET Investors are setting stock prices now based on where they see corporate profits heading in the future. And for many on Wall Street, the future looks brighter than the bleak present, in large part because of hopes that a vaccine for the new coronavirus could help things get back to normal. “Main Street is the now, Wall Street is the future,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. Companies have begun final-stage testing of potential vaccines for COVID-19, and many investors are hopeful that something could be available either late in 2020 or within a year. A return to normal could help the economy get back on track and perhaps boost profits back to record levels. Stock prices tend to track with corporate earnings over the long term. The same look-ahead mentality sent the stock market tumbling severely earlier this year, before the worst of the recession arrived. Stocks began falling in late February, a month before the number of layoffs began exploding, for example. The S&P 500 hit what turned out to be its low point on March 23, the same week that the government reported a record number of U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits, nearly 6.9 million. “Wall Street continues to look six to nine months down the road,” Stovall said.",

    text: "The bully pulpit: Trump pushes Washington, but virus resists by Jonathan Lemire And Aamer Madhani, The Associated Press Posted Aug 22, 2020 7:41 am PDT Last Updated Aug 22, 2020 at 7:48 am PDT FILE - In this March 11, 2020, file photo President Donald Trump addresses the nation from the Oval Office at the White House in Washington.

    WASHINGTON — His face framed by the golden Oval Office curtains behind him, President Donald Trump stared straight into the camera aimed at the Resolute Desk.
    It was the night of March 11, 2020. And Trump’s presidency would be forever changed.
    Trump, whose improbable election ripped up the rules of American politics, had spent three-plus years defying history and orthodoxy in a chaotic spectacle that dominated the national discourse and fervently engaged both sides of a bitterly divided country. And now, essentially for the first time, he was confronted by a crisis that was not of his own making.
    It was the kind of test presidents inevitably must face, and Trump responded with trademark certitude.
    “The virus will not have a chance against us,” Trump told Americans that night.
    Five months later, the coronavirus has killed more than 175,000 Americans and left tens of millions unemployed. And now, as Trump prepares to again accept the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday in a ceremony at the White House, he must convince an electorate that has largely disapproved of his handling of the pandemic that he is not to blame, deserves another term and that all the chaos has been worth it.
    “The future of our country and indeed our civilization is at stake on Nov. 3,” Trump said Friday.
    Trump has spent his presidency bending Washington to his will. He has transformed a public health crisis into a political litmus test. He has presided over a booming, if stratified, economy, and claimed he created it. He has again forced race to the centre of the American conversation, using federal police to enforce his view. He has alienated historic allies and changed how much of the world views the United States.
    At seminal moments — in set speeches, impromptu riffs and long-sought policy reversals, examined in this story — he has redefined, at least temporarily, the presidency.
    But he has not shaken the virus.
    ___
    THE ADDRESS
    A virus born in China had swept through Europe and reached America’s shores. Global markets were tumbling, hospitals filling, cities locking down. On the day the coronavirus was officially declared a pandemic, beloved actor Tom Hanks announced he had tested positive. The NBA suspended its season.
    And for only the second time as president, Trump addressed the nation in a formal Oval Office speech. His spoke slowly, his voice halting, and he seemed unsure of what to do with his hands.
    The U.S., he told Americans, would “expeditiously defeat this virus.” But by any measure, Trump’s address didn’t go over well: The White House had to correct significant errors — one on travel from Europe, another on international cargo — within minutes of the speech’s conclusion.
    And ever since, the virus has proven impervious to bullying tweets or the ability to dictate cable news chyrons. It has upended American politics, stripping Trump of both his most potent reelection argument, a strong economy, and the venues from which to extol it, his raucous campaign rallies.
    “Historically, demagogic power wanes when seismic events overwhelm the existing moment,” said presidential historian Jon Meacham. “Pearl Harbor crushed America First; Bloody Sunday helped break the grip of Jim Crow. The pandemic may be the seismic shift, the mind-concentrating challenge, that ends Trump’s appeal beyond his hard-core base.”
    Until now, one of Trump’s greatest skills as a politician has been to assert his own political reality, careening from headline to headline, while seemingly able to dodge scandals that would likely have ended any other political career.
    His 2016 campaign was chaos and it worked, in part due to the unpopularity of Hillary Clinton, as well as outside help both foreign (Moscow) and domestic (James Comey). The Russia investigation shadowed him throughout his first two years in office. His response: an unrelenting assault from the Oval Office on the investigators and intelligence agencies.
    In the end, special counsel Robert Mueller did not find that Trump conspired with Moscow to interfere with the election, but he also did not exonerate the president on possible charges of obstruction of justice. Trump claimed total victory. Several key aides ended up with guilty pleas, yet the president emerged relatively unscathed — only soon to enter another maelstrom over foreign help, this time his request to Ukraine to investigate his eventual Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.
    Somehow, Trump’s block-the-sun response made the third impeachment of a sitting president feel like both a foregone conclusion and an afterthought.
    He had, again, survived. But the day after his acquittal also brought an ominous milestone: the nation’s first COVID-19 death.
    ___
    THE CRASH
    When Trump made the trip to the Capitol for his State of the Union address in February, he was buoyed by polling that showed the impeachment proceedings had turned out to have little impact and Americans approved of his handling of the economy.
    “Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again,” Trump declared.
    The numbers did look good. And Trump aides were quick to credit his sweeping tax cut, one of his signature first-term achievements.
    The unemployment rate was hovering at 3.5%, a level not seen since the 1960s. The stock market, one of the president’s favourite measures of economic success, was up roughly 20% from the previous year. And workers, particularly in lower-paying jobs, were seeing wages tick up.
    Trump’s campaign advisers were giddy over signs that his message was resonating beyond the voters who had helped him win 2016. Advisers took note of the significant number of people requesting tickets to Trump rallies who hadn’t voted in the last presidential election.
    Since 1956, in the 12 months before presidential elections, only one of nine incumbent presidents lost when unemployment fell over that year (Gerald Ford in 1976), and only one was reelected when it rose (Dwight Eisenhower in 1956).
    Then came the virus.
    In a matter of weeks, the economy collapsed. Unemployment skyrocketed to 14.7% and all the gains made by the stock market since he won reelection were erased.
    The virus-weakened economy has shown some signs of improvement but it is far from being healed. Unemployment has edged down to 10.2% — still just below the peak of U.S. joblessness in the Great Recession — and the S&P 500 reached a new high.
    But the suffering for a huge slice of America remains great. More than 40% of recent layoffs are likely to become permanent job losses, by one recent estimate. The National Restaurant Association forecasts the industry could lose 5 to 7 million employees. And if the White House and Congress don’t come to terms on another aid package, the economy could go sideways after Labor Day.
    Still, Trump’s backers believe he has an argument to make.
    “I think the message needs to be in post-COVID times: Trump has got the energy, the stamina, the experience and track record to bring us back,” said Dan Eberhart, chief executive of oil services company Canary LLC and a major Republican donor.
    But with less than 10 weeks to go until Election Day, Trump has spent an inordinate amount of time on squabbles and distractions, bashing the U.S. Postal Service, warning “suburban housewives” about perceived threats to their neighbourhood idylls from affordable housing, lending credence to the right-wing QAnon conspiracy movement.
    “I don’t know what persuadable voter is moved by anti-Post Office rhetoric,” Eberhart said. “We’ve got to get the closing message right.”
    ___
    THE NEWS CONFERENCE
    Under a glistening ballroom chandelier, reporters packed into Trump’s Bedminster country club in New Jersey, waiting for the president to address shocking events that had unfolded more than 300 miles to the south on a sweltering day in August 2017.
    A clash in Charlottesville, Virginia, between white supremacists and anti-racism demonstrators had left a young woman dead, mowed down by a neo-Nazi who drove his car into a crowd of counter protesters. Trump’s response: There was hatred and bigotry on “many sides.” Days later, in a Trump Tower news conference, he again declined to denounce solely the white supremacists, speaking of “very fine people on both sides.”
    His equivocal words roiled the White House. Senior West Wing advisers threatened to quit. Republicans found their voices and condemned Trump.
    It was more than just a moment. Trump, a billionaire by some accounts, sold himself to voters as an unlikely champion of the forgotten man who would “Make America Great Again,” a slogan that was read by many as a callback to a simpler — and whiter — era in the United States.
    The president’s team showcased record low unemployment rates for African Americans and rising prosperity for minorities in the days before the pandemic. But his rhetoric and policies were viewed by many as offensive and, at times, racist.
    There was his campaign kickoff suggestion that many Mexican immigrants were “rapists.” His claim that an Indiana-born judge couldn’t be impartial because of his Latino heritage. And there was the racist lie of birtherism — Trump’s false suggestions that President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the U.S. and thus wasn’t eligible to be president.
    His moves to sharply curtail legal and illegal immigration became a frequent fault line for the administration. Thousands of Americans protested at airports in January 2017 when the White House enacted its first ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries, demonstrations that foreshadowed the uproar the following summer when the administration moved to forcibly separate migrant families at the southern border, leading to television images of weeping children pulled from their parents. And his closing — and ultimately failed — argument before the 2018 midterm elections was that dangerous caravans of migrants were headed for U.S. cities.
    “He has made explicit what has been fueling American politics since the 1960s. He is saying the quiet parts out loud,” said Eddie Glaude, chair of the department of African American studies at Princeton University. “He has made direct appeals to white grievance, to white resentment. He has dwelled in the underbelly of American politics.”
    Trump’s poll numbers, already wobbling, fell further in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer.
    As protests calling for racial justice erupted, Trump leaned in on his law-and-order cry, depicting demonstrators as “thugs.” References to Lafayette Square, the park across from the White House, now evoke images of Trump posing in front of a damaged church holding up a Bible after officers forcefully routed demonstrators from the area.
    ___
    THE SUMMIT
    Vladimir Putin smiled.
    The world was watching a post-summit news conference by the American and Russian leaders in Helsinki in July 2018, and Trump had just publicly sided with Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies on the question of election interference.
    The uproar was immediate. Even before Air Force One took off for Washington, Trump’s comments were condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike.
    Trump’s deference to Putin, beyond reviving questions about the American leader’s possible ties to Moscow, illuminated his own brand of foreign policy, one that has strained ties with Western allies, in favour of transactional relationships and a warmth toward strongmen.
    “Trump came into office believing that the cost of American world leadership was far greater than the benefits,” said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “He sees allies as economic competitors rather than strategic partners.”
    It all adds up to foreign policy wins, in the view of Trump supporters. After his prodding, more NATO members boosted spending on defence. The Islamic State, which once controlled 34,000 square miles in Syria and Iraq, has been defanged. And North Korea, which at the start of Trump’s term was widely regarded as the most volatile foreign policy issue on his plate, has remained relatively quiet.
    “We have two foreign policy presidents with Trump,” said James Carafano, national security expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “There is the showman Trump and there is the serious foreign policy Trump. We spend way too much time focusing on the showmanship.”
    Outside of Trump’s links to Putin, no relationship has attracted more scrutiny than the president’s hot-cold ties with China’s Xi Jinping.
    Trump campaigned as a China hawk but, after being feted on an extravagant state visit to Beijing, his tone softened and he was eager to strike a new trade deal. And when the virus began to ignite around Wuhan, the president was reluctant to endanger negotiations and thus slow to criticize China.
    Those days of expedient restraint are long gone, replaced by Trump’s determination to affix blame elsewhere for the pandemic that has imperiled his presidency. The coronavirus, in Trump’s telling, became the “China virus.”
    ___
    TRUTH AND CONSEQUENCE
    No one knew when Trump arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina, on March 3, that it might turn out to be the last jam-packed, big stadium rally of his presidency.
    At that point in the crisis — more than a week before the government recommended Americans sharply curtail activities to slow the spread of the virus — the number of U.S. infections had surpassed 100 and six people were confirmed dead. Trump assured the 9,600-person crowd that night he was leaning on the “greatest professionals in the world” to advise him.
    “My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and that’s what I’ll do,” declared Trump. He added, “America is so resilient, we know what we’re doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth.”
    Over the course of his presidency, Trump has leaned hard on florid overstatement, misdirection and out-right lies.
    It was a pattern set on his first full day in office when he ordered his press secretary to exaggerate the crowd size at his 2017 inauguration. Since then, he incorrectly claimed the Mueller report “totally exonerated” him, he insisted his administration was “taxing the hell out of China” even as the trade deficit grew, and he promised a sweeping health care plan that has yet to emerge.
    But his declaration at the Charlotte rally that he was getting advice from some of the greatest minds in medicine rang true. His coronavirus task force included Dr. Anthony Fauci, a renowned infectious disease expert, and Dr. Deborah Birx, who had worked with Fauci for years combating HIV/AIDS globally. Their presence gave the medical community hope that Trump would let the scientists lead him and the country through the crisis, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University.
    Trump, in both private life and in the West Wing, has always made himself the centre of power, the structure likened to “a wheel where all the spokes lead to the centre, directly to the president,” according to Chris Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax and a longtime friend of Trump.
    “There was no hierarchy at Trump Org and his White House mirrors that because, for Trump, it’s never been about organization, it is all about results,” said Ruddy.
    Reinforcing that, the Trump White House has seen an unprecedented amount of turnover among senior staff and Cabinet members, many of whom sharply criticized the president after leaving. And Trump soon began to break with the medical experts.
    “He won the benefit of the doubt in the public health community because he surrounded himself with the people who would follow the science,” Gostin said. “The problem is, it doesn’t matter if you have the right people around you if don’t listen them.”
    Trump, in defiance of federal guidelines, pushed for a rapid reopening of the economy even as public health experts warned him to go slow.
    He promoted the use of the drug hydroxychloroquine as a “game changer,” and even used it himself, despite federal warnings against taking the malaria drug to combat COVID-19. He regularly asserts that the virus will soon “go away.” And he recently dismissed a warning by the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, that the U.S. could be in for “the worst fall, from a public health perspective, we’ve ever had” if Americans don’t step up mitigation efforts, such as wearing masks.
    “I think that we’re doing very well,” Trump said. “We’re on our way.”
    That’s the bravado that Trump has projected throughout his presidency. He frequently proclaims that no president, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, has accomplished as much as he has.
    He’s moved the federal judicial system far to the right with the appointment of two conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court and more than 200 federal judges to lower courts. And he’s built more than 200 miles of his planned U.S.-Mexico wall, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign promise to slow illegal immigration.
    But in the end, Trump has often ended up his own worst enemy, unwilling or unable to check his impulses. The campaign he now faces is less a choice between candidates than a referendum on himself, a weighting he will try to reverse before November.
    And his most lasting legacy might be undermining Americans’ trust in institutions, said Brian Ott, who heads the communication department at Missouri State University and has done extensive research on the president’s social media rhetoric.
    “He has waged war on science, fact and truth,” Ott said. “He has, in short, debased the office he holds and the entire nation with his endless lying.”
